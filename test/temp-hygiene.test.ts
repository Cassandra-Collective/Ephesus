/*
 * # Which remover, and why it depends on git (2026-10-02)
 *
 * The guard first asked only that a file which makes a temp directory call a
 * remover, `removeTempDir(` or `rmSync(`. That let
 * `test/main/pacing-wakes.test.ts` tear down with
 * `fs.rmSync(dir, { recursive, force, maxRetries: 10, retryDelay: 50 })`, and on
 * linux CI (run 36924116592) the teardown threw ENOTEMPTY on `agora/.git`.
 * Node 20's synchronous `rmSync` lists a directory's children ONCE and then
 * retries only its `rmdir`, so one entry written after the listing spends the
 * whole ~2.75 s budget. The writer was git's own housekeeping: `git commit`
 * starts auto-maintenance, which on POSIX detaches and outlives the commit,
 * and a `git repack` was still writing `.git/objects/pack`. `removeTempDir`
 * lists the tree afresh on every attempt (`test/tmpdir.ts`).
 *
 * So a file that runs real git, by whatever route, may not remove a tree with
 * a raw recursive remove except as part of a test, and if it makes a temp
 * directory it must call `removeTempDir`. A removal is part of a test only when
 * every way it runs is from inside a test's registration: deleting a worktree
 * to see what the code does next is the test (`test/main/worktrees.test.ts`).
 * In a hook, a `finally`, a fixture, or a function one of those calls, it is
 * teardown; anywhere else — module or `describe` level — it is no test either.
 *
 * A file that never touches git keeps `rmSync`, on evidence rather than by
 * default. What defeats `rmSync` is something that outlives the test inside
 * its directory: a writer, or on Windows a process whose working directory it
 * is. Git is the one this suite cannot stop, because its housekeeping detaches
 * from the commit that started it, beyond anything a test can await. Checked on
 * 2026-10-02 against the four files that still tore down with `rmSync`: they
 * write synchronously, await every asynchronous read, never start a watcher's
 * timer, and run their one child through `execFileSync`, which has exited
 * before teardown begins. A file that leaves an asynchronous child running in
 * its temp directory WOULD need `removeTempDir`, and this guard does not look
 * for one: `tmpdir.test.ts` and `pin.ts` do exactly that on purpose, to measure
 * the pin, and a rule broad enough to catch it would punish the measurement.
 * That residual is recorded in
 * docs/implementations/2026-10-02-temp-hygiene-requires-remover.md.
 *
 * Every question is asked of the TypeScript syntax tree, as
 * `scripts/reachability.cjs` asks its own, and never of the text: a comment
 * that names `removeTempDir(` removes nothing, `import type` runs nothing, and
 * `'git push origin'` in a grant is data, not a command. A text match is
 * fooled by all three.
 */

/*
 * # One directory at a time, and the ones mkdtemp never made (2026-10-02)
 *
 * The rule above was a property of a FILE: one that made a temp directory had
 * to call a remover somewhere. That let four kinds of leak through, one of
 * them live:
 *
 * - `test/main/gates.test.ts` gave a `PromptStore` the home
 *   `path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'eph-prompts-<pid>')`. `read()` creates the home
 *   and seeds it, nothing removed it, and nine of them were in %TEMP% on
 *   2026-10-02 — invisible here, because no mkdtemp made them.
 * - `test/scenarios/company.ts` made every company's home and left removing it
 *   to `cleanupHomes()`, which each scenario file had to call. The call sat in
 *   an exported function, so the helper "called a remover" whether or not any
 *   scenario ever ran it.
 * - A `makeTempDir()` beside `removeTempDir` would have handed every directory
 *   it made to callers no file is judged for.
 * - A file that removed its first directory was excused every other.
 *
 * So each directory is now followed from the call that makes it — through
 * variables, the lists it is pushed into, and functions here that return it —
 * to a remover, and a remover counts only if this file RUNS it whenever the
 * directory is made: in the same function body, or from a test, a hook or
 * the file's top level. A removal in a function the file only exports, or
 * only keeps — a rig object's `close()`, a closure it returns or pushes onto
 * a list — counts for nothing, and so does one in a named function that only
 * such code calls: that is what moved `cleanupHomes()` into a module-level
 * hook of `company.ts`'s own, and the rigs' homes into lists their hooks
 * empty. A function that hands a directory back is judged at each of its
 * calls when calls are all the file does with it, and refused otherwise.
 * Variables are told apart by scope, through a type checker over the one
 * file, because test after test declares its own `const home`. And a path
 * named on the temp root outside an mkdtemp call is treated as a directory
 * nothing removes, unless `UNMADE_TEMP_PATHS` lists it, with how many times
 * the file names it and why nothing is left there. What this still cannot
 * see is recorded in docs/implementations/2026-10-02-temp-hygiene-blind-spots.md.

 * from its syntax tree. `fileName` is where it lives, repo-relative, which is
 * how its imports resolve, and chooses the dialect (`.tsx`, `.cjs`).
 *
 * It looks for CALLS, never for names. Written first as
 * `includes('removeTempDir')`, the guard survived the one mutation that
 * mattered: deleting a teardown's body leaves the `import { removeTempDir }`
 * line behind, so the file still "mentioned" the helper while removing
 * nothing. A shape check standing in for a semantic one is this repository's
 * oldest recurring defect, and it had reproduced inside the very test written
 * to prevent it.
