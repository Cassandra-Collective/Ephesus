 * The Stoa's driver (ADR-0017, FR-13, SDD §4.7/§7.7).

 * `agora/stoa/watchlist.json` is the ONLY set of sources the company may
 * study, and this class is the only thing that writes it. Two properties are
 * load-bearing and both are structural rather than advisory:
 *
 * - **Curation is Architect-only** (R1, FR-13.1). `register`/`retire` take a
 *   `by` from the CALLER, and the only caller that may pass `architect` is the
 *   IPC handler — which knows it is the Architect because the call arrived on
 *   the window bridge. Nothing here accepts a claimed identity from an agent,
 *   and there is no agent-facing path to this file at all.
 * - **Nothing is deleted.** Retiring moves an entry to `retired`, verbatim.
 *   The build-phase watchlist strikes retired rows through rather than
 *   removing them, and the running system keeps that habit: a source the
 *   company used to study is part of how its briefs came to exist.
 *
 * At first run the watchlist seeds from the repository's own `docs/stoa/`
 * (FR-13.7) — the markdown table AND `briefs/`, together. The Gymnasium seed
 * shipped its ledger without its proposals once and every row's link broke
 * (M5 close-out audit, finding 3); a watchlist whose briefs did not cross over
 * would be the same half-archive one subsystem over.
