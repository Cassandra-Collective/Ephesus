/**
 * Grep-able invariant tripwires (ENGINEERING-STANDARDS §5). These are the rules
 * a reviewer cannot reliably hold in their head, so CI holds them instead.
 *
 * 1. ADR-0004 / invariant §4 — only the main process runs git, and only through
 *    `src/main/git.ts`. A `git` invocation anywhere else is the failure mode the
 *    whole single-committer design exists to prevent.
 * 2. Invariant §5 — `log.jsonl` and the cost ledger are append-only. A truncating
 *    write to either is a rewrite of the book of record — and since M3.2 the
 *    ledger is a SQL table, so the rewrite vector is `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, which a
 *    `writeFileSync` pattern cannot see.
 * 3. ENGINEERING-STANDARDS §5 / ADR-0010 — credentials reach code in exactly one
 *    way. Nothing outside `watch/` and `herald/` reads a credential out of the
 *    process environment, and no fixture anywhere carries a secret-shaped
 *    string: the M1 audit found one (`ghp_…`) and renamed it, and a tripwire is
 *    the only thing that keeps the next one out.
 * 4. Invariant §6 / UI-DESIGN §6 — the floor's model modules own no clock; a
 *    projection that reads the time is a second source of truth (ADR-0014).
 * 5. Invariant §7 / M8.1 — main reaches the renderer through one object. A
 *    destroyed window is not null, and every send on the quit path threw.

 * one line.
 *
