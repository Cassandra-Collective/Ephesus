/**
 * One mutation round, run from one checked-in spec (GYM-008, TEST-STRATEGY §10).
 *
 *   node scripts/mutate.cjs test/mutation/<package>.json [--check]
 *       [--retries <n>] [--retry-wait <seconds>] [--timeout <seconds>]
 *
 * A round plants one hand-aimed change at a time in the code a package claims
 * to defend, runs the package's test files against each, and puts the file
 * back. A mutant the tests fail is KILLED; one they pass is a SURVIVOR, and a
 * survivor is a question, not a score. Exit status: 0 the round is OK, 1 it
 * has survivors, 2 it is INVALID — it could not be scored, and saying so is
 * the point.
 *
 * This was a scratch script for three milestones and it was rebuilt from
 * memory each time; every requirement below is a way an earlier round lied.
 *
 * 1. A planted no-op CONTROL must survive, and a spec that declares none is
 *    refused: a round that cannot tell an unearned kill from a real one has
 *    no certificate.
 * 2. The suite runs once before the first mutant, and the round stops unless
 *    it is green — a red baseline makes every mutant, the control included,
 *    look killed (M8b.3).
 * 3. A run is read from vitest's JSON report, never from its exit code alone:
 *    the suite's free-memory gate refuses to start and exits 1
 *    (`test/global-setup.ts`), and a harness scoring by exit code reported
 *    those refusals as clean sweeps (2026-09-09, 2026-10-02). A run in which no
 *    file ran, or a listed file did not run, or an unlisted one did, is
 *    INVALID; a refusal to start is retried after a wait.
 * 4. Every file in the round — the mutated files, the test files and the spec
 *    — is hashed when the round starts, after every run and after every
 *    restore, and every mutant is built from the bytes the round started with.
 *    OneDrive put a restored file back with a mutant in it, twice, seconds
 *    after its check had passed (2026-09-09, 2026-10-02).
 * 5. Files are read and written as bytes, so a restore is exact and a CRLF
 *    never appears in an LF file.
 * 6. The round's files must be committed, clean and plainly tracked:
 *    `git checkout --` is the restore and `git status` a second check. That is
 *    why this file is in `GIT_ALLOWLIST` (`scripts/check-invariants.cjs`) and
 *    `GIT_DOORS` (`test/temp-hygiene.test.ts`): it runs git on the development
 *    repository and never on a harness home (DECISIONS-LOG 2026-10-03).
 * 7. Every run prints the test files it actually ran. A score is scoped to
 *    them, and M8b.3's 6 of 6 kills were followed by two scenario failures the
 *    round never loaded.
 * 8. Every anchor matches its file exactly once, checked before the baseline:
 *    an anchor matching nothing makes a mutant a no-op that "survives", and one
 *    matching twice is an edit nobody chose.
 * 9. A survivor exits 1 and prints the triage question, so it stops the round
 *    instead of decorating a table.
 *
 * And what an adversarial pass then broke, every case reproduced before it
 * was closed (DECISIONS-LOG 2026-10-03): a run is scored over the tests that
 * PASSED at the baseline, so a skipped file defends nothing and a worker that
 * dies is not a survival; a report with no failure from a vitest that exited
 * non-zero (an unhandled error, a dead worker) is INVALID; the whole working
 * tree is guarded, not only the round's files; a round file must sit inside
 * the repository by its real path, have one hard link, hold the bytes git
 * indexed and carry no flag that hides it from git; a timed-out run is
 * INVALID and not retried; and a spec cannot name a path vitest would read as
 * an option, or an anchor in malformed Unicode. A second pass found eleven more
 * ways in, recorded as the round's known limits in TEST-STRATEGY §10 rather
 * than closed; of them only the kill rule changed: a kill needs a test that
 * passed at the baseline to fail, or a listed file that cannot load.
 *
 * The round trusts the repository's own tests and configuration. Test code or
 * config written to deceive it — a reporter-rewriting config, a detached
 * writer — can forge any verdict (THREAT-MODEL.md).
