# Brand marks

The Ephesus mark is an Ionic column — the one still standing at the Artemision.
Terracotta capital, marble shaft, drawn to [`../design/UI-DESIGN.md`](../design/UI-DESIGN.md).

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `ephesus-16.svg` | Favicon, and anywhere under 24 px |
| `ephesus-32.svg` | Small UI, list rows, tab strips |
| `ephesus-64.svg` | The master drawing |
| `ephesus-128.svg` | README header, docs, anywhere large |
| `ephesus-column-52.svg` | The column alone, no field — for anywhere the host supplies the background |
| `ephesus-column-520.png` | Upload-ready: GitHub **App logos**, where GitHub paints the badge behind it |
| `ephesus-round-64.svg` | The round mark, for anywhere nothing supplies a background |
| `ephesus-round-512.png` | Upload-ready: **org and profile avatars**, which are shown as-is |
| `ephesus-social-card.svg` | 1280×640 GitHub social preview; built, not hand-edited (see below) |

## Each size is redrawn, not scaled

This is the part to know before editing any of them.

The 64-unit master has **1-unit flute grooves** and a 2×2 volute eye. Render it at
32 px and one unit is half a pixel: the grooves land between pixels, the renderer
averages them into the flutes, and the shaft goes flat — losing precisely the
detail that makes it read as a cylinder rather than a bar. At 16 px the capital
collapses entirely.

So each size has a detail budget it can actually spend:

| Grid | Capital | Shaft | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| 64 | abacus, paired volutes with recessed eyes, echinus | 4 flutes + 3 grooves | torus, scotia, plinth |
| 32 | volutes as solid blocks, no eyes | 2 flutes + 2 grooves | scotia dropped |
| 16 | one terracotta band | 2 flutes + 1 groove | two rows |

`ephesus-128.svg` is the 64 artwork at an integer 2×, which stays crisp.

**Detail that cannot resolve is worse than no detail.** If you add a size, redraw
it — do not scale.

## The rules these obey

Every mark conforms to [`../design/UI-DESIGN.md`](../design/UI-DESIGN.md):

- **Only §2 tokens.** No invented hex. Each file uses 7 colours, inside §1.3's
  ceiling of 8.
- **Integer coordinates only**, with `shape-rendering="crispEdges"`. §1.1 makes
  pixel-snapping a hard rule, so there are no half-pixels and no anti-aliased
  curves anywhere in these files.
- **Light from the upper left**, consistently: the flute ramp runs light to
  shadow left-to-right, and every horizontal moulding carries a shadow row
  beneath it. That consistency is what reads as depth — outlines alone do not.

Both properties are mechanically checkable, and worth re-checking after any edit:

```bash
# every colour must appear in UI-DESIGN.md, and no coordinate may be fractional
grep -ohE '#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}' docs/brand/*.svg | sort -u
grep -ohE '(x|y|width|height)="[0-9]*\.[0-9]+"' docs/brand/*.svg   # must print nothing
```

## The round mark is a redraw, not a crop

`ephesus-round-64.svg` exists because **cropping the square mark to a circle cuts the
column's corners off**. The abacus and the plinth are the widest parts of the drawing
and they sit at the very top and bottom — exactly where a circle is at its narrowest.
A circular mask over `ephesus-64.svg` removes 57,062 of its 262,144 pixels at 512 px,
including both ends of the plinth.

So the round mark keeps the master's shaft column-for-column — that is the part with
the flutes, and the part a reader recognises — and redraws only the capital and base,
34 units wide instead of 36. The column is 34×48 inside a 62-unit disc: the largest
the master's proportions go before a corner touches the field, leaving 1.3 units of
marble at the plinth. The ring is one unit rather than two for the same reason —
every unit spent on the ring is a unit the column cannot have.

**The disc is inset one unit from the canvas edge, and that is load-bearing.** GitHub
scales the upload and masks it to a circle itself. If our disc ran to r=32 the host's
mask would land on our stepped edge and shave it into a smooth one, losing the pixel
edge that makes it part of this family. At r=31 the mask passes through empty space
and the artwork survives untouched — verified by applying a full-radius circular mask
and diffing: 0 pixels lost, against 57,062 for the square mark.

The four canvas corners are transparent, so the same file also survives a rounded-square
mask, and reads on GitHub's dark canvas as well as its light one.

## Which one to upload where

The two round files answer different questions, and the difference is **who paints the
background**.

A **GitHub App logo** is composited onto a badge whose colour you choose on the same
settings page. GitHub already supplies a circle, so a mark that brings its own marble
disc puts a roundel inside a roundel and the column ends up small in the middle. Upload
`ephesus-column-520.png` there: it is the master column with the two background plates
deleted and the viewBox cropped to the column's own bounding box — nothing redrawn, and
nothing scaled. It runs edge to edge vertically, 69% wide, because a column is not square.

Set the **badge background to `F4EDE0`**. That is the marble the mark was drawn on, so
every shadow row and dark edge in the column was chosen against exactly that colour. The
tempting choice, `C4552D`, is the abacus's own colour and swallows the capital; `221A14`
and `4A3B2C` swallow the shaft's shadow side for the same reason.

An **org or profile avatar** is shown as uploaded, with no badge behind it. There
`ephesus-round-512.png` is right — it brings its own field and ring.

One honest trade: on the App settings page GitHub also previews the raw upload on a dark
tile, and the field-less column reads poorly there because its own dark side merges with
the tile. The badge is what users see; the tile is a settings-page artefact.

## The social card's wordmark is drawn, not typed

`ephesus-social-card.svg` spells EPHESUS with rectangles from a 5×7 bitmap rather
than setting it in Press Start 2P. The app bundles that face, but whatever
rasterises this file will not have it, and a silent fallback to Arial would break
§3's typography rule. Drawn glyphs cannot fall back.

GitHub's social preview needs PNG or JPG, so the card must be rasterised before
upload. Since 2026-10-15 that is done for you: the card is built in VectorCraft by the
Cassandra Collective's brand script, `python brand/tools/build_brand.py --ephesus-out <this
checkout>` in `Cassandra-Collective/.github`. It draws this folder's column and wordmark,
vendored there rect for rect, sets the text in IBM Plex Mono, and writes three files here:
`ephesus-social-card.svg`, `site/public/img/social-card.svg` and the upload-ready
`site/public/img/social-card.png`. Before writing, it checks the SVG against the rules
above: §2 tokens only, integer coordinates, `crispEdges`. To change the card, change the
build there and rebuild; an edit made here by hand is lost at the next build.
