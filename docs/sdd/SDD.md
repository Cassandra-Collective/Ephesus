# Ephesus — Software Design Description (SDD)

**Version:** 1.0 · **Status:** Approved for implementation
**Satisfies:** the [SRS](../srs/SRS.md) — §12 maps every FR to its design section,
plus the NFRs whose design is a section rather than a property of the whole ·
**Justified by:** the [accepted ADRs](../adr/README.md), cited per section

*(Stated as ranges through M8.7 — "FR-1…FR-12, ADR-0001…0015" — which had been
wrong since FR-13 and ADR-0016 landed and would go stale again on the next
addition. A pointer to the index maintains itself; §12 carries the mapping that
actually has to be kept true.)*

This document describes *how* Ephesus is built: process architecture, module map, data
models, on-disk formats, IPC contracts, state machines, and the key runtime sequences.
Where a design choice needs justification, it cites the ADR rather than re-arguing it.

---

## 1. Process architecture

Three OS-level tiers (ADR-0001, ADR-0002):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Electron MAIN (Node, privileged)                                        │
│  pty.ts hermes.ts agora.ts artemis.ts library.ts odeon.ts herald/      │
│  harbor/ watch/ engines/ hooks.ts scheduler.ts db.ts config.ts ipc.ts  │
│  control.ts (the second front door — ADR-0033)                         │
│  home-lock.ts (one harness per home — ADR-0034)                        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PRELOAD (contextBridge) → typed window.eph API — the ONLY renderer door │

          ▲ per-id IPC: pty bytes, events, state snapshots
          │
   ┌──────┴───────────────┐     ┌───────────────────────────────┐
   │ Agent processes      │     │ Hook shims (eph-hook et al.)  │
   │ (claude/codex/… in   │────►│ POST lifecycle JSON to        │
   │  node-pty PTYs)      │     │ ~/.ephesus/events.sock        │
   └──────────────────────┘     └───────────────────────────────┘
```

**Trust boundaries.** The renderer is untrusted (renders agent/internet-derived
content): no Node, no fs, no secrets (NFR-8; ADR-0010). Agent processes are
semi-trusted (prompt-injectable): least-privilege env, gated actions, redaction filter.
The hook socket is `0600` with a per-spawn token in each payload.

### 1.1 Main-process module map

| Module | Owns | Key ADR |
|---|---|---|
| `engines/` | `EngineAdapter` registry: `claude.ts` (reference), `codex.ts`, `gemini.ts`, `grok.ts`, `opencode.ts`, `custom.ts`, plus `engine-home.ts` — the one engine-AGNOSTIC function naming an engine's private per-agent config directory (ADR-0026). `claude.ts` alone implements `trustWorkspace` (ADR-0021/0025) and `prepareConfigDir` (ADR-0026) — the engine's own per-workspace trust record is a Claude Code fact, and core never learns what a project key looks like | 0009, 0021, 0025, 0026 |
| `agents.ts` | `AgentManager`: spawn ordering (probe → token → identity → settings → process), FR-1.6 install offer, exit unwind (settings restored, token revoked) | 0009, 0010 |
| `pty.ts` | `PtyManager`: spawn/write/resize/interrupt/kill/resume; PATH resolution for spawn plans (`which.ts`); the redaction filter on outbound streams, wired in `pty-stream.ts` (split out so it is testable without node-pty) | 0014, 0010 |
| `avatars.ts` | `AvatarDirector`: hook events → §6 avatar snapshots, the walk clock (`arrive`) and the §6 timers | 0002 |
| `commands.ts` | `CommandQueue`: FR-1.3 queue-until-idle, held text, two-write submit | — |
| `prompts.ts` | `PromptStore`: harness-home-first prompt/template loading, seeded from the bundled copies | — |
| `hooks.ts` | UDS/named-pipe server; payload validation; schema-drift warnings; PTY-heuristic fallback registration | 0002 |
| `hermes.ts` | Outbox watchers, delivery (temp+rename), hop-cap diversion, bounce, broadcast fan-out, wake watchdog, Stop-hook decisioning | 0003, 0013 |
| `git.ts` | The **only** module that invokes `git` in the app, worktree isolation (UC-01 2a) and `readRemotes` (M8.5, a read of the target checkout — commits nothing) included. ADR-0004's single-committer claim lives here, and CI fails on a `git` call anywhere else — except the named development-repo tools in `check-invariants.cjs`'s allowlist, which run outside the app process and never touch a harness home | 0004 |
| `eventlog.ts` | `log.jsonl` appender/reader: seq recovery, append-only writes, tolerance of a torn tail from a killed harness, and the readers a consumer needs beyond a cursor window — `tailOf` (the newest, for a live view) and the unbounded read behind `Agora.readLogAll`/`readLogSince` (for the standup, the org metrics and the proof gate, which must see everything) | 0004 |
| `settings-registry.ts` | Durable record of settings files written into an agent's repo, so a force-killed harness can undo them on the next boot | 0009 |
| `agora.ts` | On-disk layout, registry/ledger/board accessors, `log.jsonl` appender AND its publish/subscribe (`onAppend` — the single writer publishes, so no appender has to remember to notify anybody), the whole-log readers with their cost reported, the single git committer (queue, retry+backoff, startup reconcile) | 0004 |
| `ledger.ts` | The task-ledger endpoint (§7.1): validates Artemis's `propose` acts and writes `tasks.json` and `board.md` through the single committer — agents never touch either file | 0005, 0004 |
| `artemis.ts` | Orchestrator lifecycle: auto-spawn, reserved seat, respawn-with-memory, prompt/config assembly, delegated-authority table. The backoff ladder itself moved to `respawn.ts` at M8.6; what stays here is the orchestrator's own policy — that a company with no orchestrator is a degradation the Architect must be told about, and that her roster seat is cleared when she will not be coming back | 0005 |
| `respawn.ts` | `RespawnLadder` (one agent's attempts, backoff, stability window, capacity hold and the standing-decision veto), `CrewSurvival` (one ladder per hire that declared `onExit: "respawn"`) and `createCrewSurvival` (the log kind, the degradation causes and the "still down" reading, kept out of `index.ts` so they are testable). Added M8.6: FR-5.4's ladder had exactly one user while three crew agents logged terminal exits four, five and five times in a day and nothing brought any of them back | 0011 |
| `library.ts` | Memory read/write helpers, the corpus, the recall ladder and its visible state, MemPalace driver (`eph-recall`, archive ingestion), reflection scheduler, knowledge shelf. `library-fts.ts` holds the FTS rung's behaviour (mtime gate, scoring, scope) and `library-fts-sqlite.ts` its SQLite FTS5 storage, split so the native module stays out of the test runner; `library-mempalace.ts` drives the MemPalace CLI under ADR-0009's subprocess discipline (version probe, visible install offer, no daemon flags, engine-side auto-save hooks forced off) | 0006, 0016 |
| `odeon.ts` | Briefing compiler, deck-gate on task close, memo policy engine + queues + verdict routing, meeting driver (turn-taking, minutes) | 0008 |
| `herald/` | `seam.ts` (STT/TTS/Duplex interfaces), `policy.ts` (wake word, barge-in, repeat-back, failover), `elevenlabs.ts`, `openai-realtime.ts` | 0007 |
| `harbor/` | `github.ts` (issues/PRs/CI via `gh`), `bridge.ts` (chat bridge), `webhooks.ts`, `hires.ts` (export/import) | — |
| `watch/` | `gates.ts` (approval queue + policy; since M8.8 the open set AND the settled verdicts are durable, and `restore()` puts both back without re-announcing them — ADR-0027), `budgets.ts` + `ledger.ts` (durable cost), `breaker.ts` (ladder; rung-3 STOPS are durable via `breaker-store.ts`, rungs 1–2 deliberately are not — ADR-0027 §5), `telemetry.ts` (OTel spans, waterfall), `secrets.ts` + `cipher.ts` (write-only broker, OS-keychain seam) | 0011, 0010, 0027 |
| `profiles.ts` | Profile load/validate/activate/instantiate; schema versioning. Since M8.5 the activation preview is asynchronous, because it READS the target checkout's remotes rather than remembering them, and an instance that comes up watching no repository reports it (`onWatchesNothing`). The pure half — parsing a remote URL, and refusing to choose between a fork's two — is `shared/repo-remote.ts`. Since M8.8 an instance carries `crew` (`live` | `down`) and `restore()` puts previously-live instances back with their crews DOWN (ADR-0027): it arms no triggers, and `activate` TAKES OVER a `down` instance rather than refusing it as a duplicate — otherwise the restore would block the reactivation that brings the crew back | 0012, 0027 |
| `org.ts` | Departments, hire-template versioning, per-agent metrics, review/retro reports | — |
| `gymnasium.ts` | Improvement-proposal validation (metric + rollback required), ledger accessors, gate classification, metric-check scheduling, rollback driver | 0015 |
| `stoa.ts` | Watchlist accessors (Architect-only mutation, enforced in the handler like `gym.verdict`), researcher spawn plans (read-only checkout, no secret grants), brief validation (uncited finding ⇒ rejected pre-human), brief archive. The cadence tick itself is `stoa-cadence.ts` (a scheduler client, mode-gated — shipped body, exercised by the suites) | 0017, 0018 |
| `modes.ts` | `CompanyModes` (ADR-0018): mode persistence through `config.json`'s atomic path, the §6.9 proof-gate check over the gym ledger + log (constants in `shared/mode.ts`), ledgered mode changes, the breaker's rung-3 revert (roles per `isImprovementRole`) | 0018 |
| `scheduler.ts` | Cron-like triggers (standups, reflection, reviews, profile triggers) with idempotent ticks — a trigger fires at most once per interval and is never re-entered while running. Since M8.8 the last-fired clock is keyed by trigger id INDEPENDENTLY of registration and is durable (ADR-0027, §4.8): it is the one piece of scheduler state a restart cannot re-derive, and losing it makes every restored trigger due immediately. It is also the ONLY copy of that fact — a second copy on the registration was removed when a mutation pass showed no test could tell which one `add` preferred. `reflection.ts` is its first client: it asks an agent to condense its own memory (ADR-0006 layer 3) and applies what the agent proposes back to the reserved `agent.library` endpoint — the harness never summarizes (ADR-0005) | 0006, 0005 |
| `db.ts` | SQLite: app-local state (window bounds, command history) + cost ledger | 0004, 0011 |
| `config.ts` | Harness home setup, config persistence (text assets are loaded by `prompts.ts`) | — |
| `home.ts` | The harness home's shape: `HOME_DIRS`, creation, `config.json` load with a visible warning on a corrupt file, and the first-boot seeding of the files the harness requires — `gate-policy.json` and `authority.json`, written from schema-validated values, only when absent, and reported so the Architect learns they exist (M8.4) | — |
| `fsx.ts` | `writeFileAtomic` — temp file + rename, the one write path for anything another process reads (invariant §3) | 0003 |
| `home-lock.ts` | One harness per home (M8.14 follow-up, ADR-0034): `isListening` — the socket probe both endpoints and the boot check share — and `occupiedBy`, which answers whether another harness is already working on this home by probing what a live one would be serving. **No lockfile**: a pidfile would owe a schema, a stale-lock policy and a release on every exit route; two live sockets answer the same question and leave nothing behind after a crash. The address file is a courtesy that names the owner, never the authority | 0034, 0004 |
| `degradations.ts` | The degradation channel (M8.2): one entry per CAUSE rather than per occurrence, the bounded ladder that decides what reaches `log.jsonl`, the clear, and the boot replay that marks a surviving condition as carried over. The model and the line the Architect reads are `shared/degradation.ts` | 0004 |
| `state-store.ts` | `JsonStateStore<T>` — one mechanism for the app-local durable records a restart restores (ADR-0027): schema-validated on read AND before write, atomic through `fsx.ts`, and it distinguishes an ABSENT file (an ordinary first run) from a DAMAGED one (state exists that can no longer be read). Collapsing those two is how a restart that restored nothing looks healthy. `load` never throws, because boot runs before the window exists. `FileBreakerStopStore` is deliberately not migrated onto it — its `load` throws by design, which is a safety contract this class does not offer | 0027 |
| `restore.ts` | The boot replay (ADR-0027): owns the ORDER the records come back in and what happens when one cannot be read — the two things no individual store can own. One damaged record costs its own subsystem and nothing else; every loss becomes a `restart/*` degradation naming its consequence. Also `activationsRecord`, the one place the live set is converted to its on-disk form | 0027, 0012 |
| `index.ts` | Boot and wiring: constructs every module above, connects the two planes, registers IPC, calls the boot replay (§7.9), and hands the quit to `shutdown.ts`. Holds no logic of its own | 0001, 0027 |
| `shutdown.ts` | The quit sequence (M8.1): closing time, then the agent unwind, then the stops, each phase isolated so one failure never skips the next; idempotent, Electron-free, and driven by the scenario suite as well as by `index.ts` | 0001 |
| `ui-bridge.ts` | The one door from main to the renderer (M8.1): owns the window, forgets it when it closes, refuses to send to a destroyed one, and is the `PtySink` the terminal stream writes to. A `webContents.send` anywhere else fails `check-invariants` | 0001, 0014 |
| `ipc.ts` | Registers every handler behind the typed preload surface | 0001 |
| `control.ts` | The control surface (M8.14): a second front door onto the SAME `IpcDeps` the window is served from, so a script can run the company without the window. Owner-only socket / local named pipe mirroring `hooks.ts`, a separate address from it (agents hold that one); validates in main like any untrusted caller; refuses the four verbs only a human may perform, by name and with a reason; tags every act that CHANGES something `remote` in `log.jsonl` (FR-10.3) and deliberately logs no reads. `ControlDeps` is a `Pick<IpcDeps, …>`, which is what makes the window and the CLI unable to drift. The verb table, the refusal list and every rendered answer are pure, in `shared/control.ts`; the client is `scripts/ephctl.cjs` and holds none of them | 0033, 0010 |
| `engines/native.ts` *(planned, M9.2)* | The native engine's adapter (ADR-0036): spawns `eph-agent` in a PTY, declares `hooks: 'native'` and `autonomySupport: 'enforced'`, writes no settings into any cwd, exports the provider endpoint and the hire's model as spawn env, and reads the engine's own JSONL transcript. A fourth subject in the conformance table, never a special case | 0036 |
| `src/engine/` *(planned, M9.2–M9.5)* | `eph-agent`, Ephesus's own agent program — a separate TypeScript build target (`tsconfig.engine.json` → `out/engine/`, DD-M9-5) run by system `node`, importing only `node:` builtins and the shared hook client, like the shims. Owns the loop, the provider seam, the closed tool registry, context compaction and the transcript. §13 | 0036, 0038, 0039 |
| `bench/` + `scripts/bench.cjs` *(planned, M9.1)* | The bench (ADR-0037): schema'd tasks, a runner that drives the company through the control surface only, a scorer over `log.jsonl` and the cost ledger, and the append-only `docs/bench/LEDGER.md`. §13.5 | 0037, 0033 |

```

Rules: agents write only inside their own `agents/<id>/` and their assigned worktrees;
`board.md` only via Artemis; `log.jsonl` and `odeon/` only via the harness; the `index/`
directory is derived state and excluded from the Agora repo.

## 3. Engine adapter surface

Defined normatively in ADR-0009. Runtime notes:

- `SpawnPlan` composes: argv, cwd (target repo or worktree — a spawn requesting
  `worktree: true` has its cwd replaced by an isolated checkout before anything
  is written, so grants, settings install and transcripts all follow it), env = base ∪ role-declared
  secret grants (ADR-0010) ∪ `EPH_AGENT_ID`/`EPH_HOOK_TOKEN` ∪ the engine-isolation
  pair (ADR-0026), and settings injection.
- **Engine isolation (M8.7a, ADR-0026).** Every hire runs its own engine
  install. `AgentSpawnConfig.engineConfigDir` names it —
  `~/.ephesus/engines/<engineId>/<agentId>/`, produced by the single function
  `engineConfigDir` — and the Claude adapter exports `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (that
  directory) and `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR` (the Architect's real config
  directory, so the credentials are borrowed rather than absent). Everything the
  engine keeps per agent moves with it, so the transcript reader, the workspace
  trust record and the auth probe all read `engineConfigDir` rather than
  recomputing `$HOME`.
  The harness is the only hook author: argv carries `--setting-sources=` (no
  user, project or local settings are loaded) and `--settings
  <configDir>/eph-settings.json`. The settings file therefore lives OUTSIDE
  every checkout — ADR-0009's "write only a local variant into the agent's cwd,
  backed up, restored on uninstall" is narrowed to adapters that still write
  into a cwd, and the conformance suite splits the two cases on `settingsRoot`.
  A config directory the engine has never seen is prepared first
  (`prepareConfigDir`, which records the onboarding the Architect already
  completed); one that cannot be prepared REFUSES the spawn.
  **Granted tools (M8.7b).** Because no settings source is read, a target
  repository cannot hand an agent skills or subagents either. A hire template
  declares `tools` — a named root (`target` or `home`, the latter being
  `~/.ephesus/tools/`) plus a relative path — which
  `main/engines/tool-grants.ts` resolves, REFUSING any path that escapes its
  root and REPORTING one that is simply absent (the `envGrants` precedent,
  ADR-0010). Each resolved directory reaches the engine as one `--plugin-dir`.
  `ProfileActivations.toolsFor` and `autonomyFor` both answer from
  `planFor(agentId)`, which covers a plan whose hires are being spawned right
  now as well as a live instance — the spawn path asks both questions while
  the spawn is in progress.

- **Who asks for `worktree: true` (M8.6, `src/shared/isolation.ts`).** A bare
  `agents.spawn` (UC-01, where the Architect typed the working directory and
  confirmed one agent) keeps the schema's optional-false default. A PROFILE
  activation — several hires from one confirmation — composes it, in the shape
  `composeAutonomyTable` already uses for autonomy: hire template → profile
  document → built-in default, then the Architect's per-activation choice
  (`as-declared` / `isolate-all` / `none`), then a clamp for a target that has
  no repository to make a worktree of. **The built-in default is `worktree`**:
  a bundle that declares nothing gets isolation rather than the Architect's
  checkout, which is what both shipped bundles did for their entire production
  life. `PlannedHire.spawn.worktree` is DERIVED from `PlannedHire.isolation.effective`
  in one expression, so the sentence the activation screen renders and the flag
  the spawn carries are the same decision; a test asserts that equality for
  every planned hire under every choice. Whether the worktree can actually be
  made is deliberately not pre-checked — the create is the truth, and a screen
  that says "ok" before a `git worktree add` that fails is two code paths that
  can disagree (the M8.5 lesson).
- **Isolation moves the agent, so the engine's workspace trust must follow it**
  (ADR-0025, M8.7). Claude Code asks once per working directory whether a human
  trusts it, keyed on the exact resolved path, and it asks BEFORE a session
  exists — so no hook fires and a parked agent reports nothing. ADR-0021 answers
  that at activation with the target; once M8.6 made isolation the default, the
  target was no longer where any hire worked. `ProfileActivations` therefore
  calls `beforeHires(plan)` after the plan is fixed and before the first
  process, and `index.ts` trusts every directory in
  `plannedWorkspaces(plan, worktreePathFor)`: the target (`must-exist`, resolved
  through `realpath` in full) and one entry per isolated hire
  (`will-be-created`, whose leaf git has not made yet, so the PARENT is resolved
  and the leaf appended — the parent is `<home>/worktrees`, which the harness
  owns). Both the trusted set and the spawned set come from the one plan object;
  a second derivation would put the record at a path nothing reads, and the only
  symptom of that is an agent that hangs. Trust is still written from an
  activation and nowhere else — never from spawn, respawn or a wake (ADR-0021,
  unchanged).
- **An emptied worktree path is reusable; anything else is still refused**
  (2026-09-06). `Worktrees.create` will not write into a path it cannot prove is
  the agent's own checkout, which is how "never destroy an agent's uncommitted
  work" is enforced at create time. That proof is two `git rev-parse` calls
  inside the directory, and an EMPTY directory fails both — so a worktree whose
  contents git removed while a held directory handle (OneDrive, a watcher, an
  open shell) kept the directory standing refused the agent's respawn, and every
  respawn after it, for good. The guard was asking about identity to decide a
  question about contents. `worktreePathIsVacant` asks the real one: an empty
  real directory holds no work, and `git worktree add` accepts it as it stands,
  so `create` prunes git's stale administrative entry (`remove`'s reason,
  applied at the other end) and proceeds. Nothing is deleted on this route —
  keeping this module's promise not to destroy anything at a worktree path, and
  removing a "could not remove it" state no portable test can reach. A populated
  directory, a file, a checkout on another branch, and a path that cannot be
  listed all still refuse, and the reason names which. The vacancy check uses
  `lstat`: through `stat` a junction reads as an ordinary empty directory and
  would land the checkout in a directory nobody approved (ADR-0021's guard, at a
  second doorway).
- **A hire also declares what happens when it dies** (`onExit: "offer" | "respawn"`,
  same two layers, default `offer` = SDD §10's own word). Both fields are
  additive and optional on `hireTemplateSchema` and `profileDocumentSchema`, so
  every document written against the previous shape still validates — the same
  reasoning `budget` carried at M7.1 — and neither costs a `schemaVersion` bump.
  The two shipped bundles declare theirs explicitly and took a version bump for
  it, because ADR-0012 makes the profile version a record of what an Architect
  approved.
- **Identity injection:** at spawn the adapter arranges for `identity.md` +
  `PROTOCOL.md` + the agent's **memory layer** to reach the agent (engine-native
  context file, `--append-system-prompt`, or first-prompt injection — adapter's
  choice, conformance-tested for effect not mechanism). The memory layer arrives
  on `AgentSpawnConfig.memory` as text the Library has already composed and
  budgeted (ADR-0006 layer 1): an adapter never decides how much of a long
  `memory.md` a spawn can carry.
- **Hook fidelity grades** (`native` | `wrapper` | `pty-heuristic`) surface on the agent
  card and scale down floor detail and breaker sensitivity (ADR-0011, 0014).
- `TranscriptReader` yields token/cost facts folded into the ledger (FR-11.2).
- **The native kind (ADR-0036, planned M9).** `native.ts` builds a `SpawnPlan` whose
  argv is `node out/engine/eph-agent.js`, whose env carries the harness pair plus
  `EPH_PROVIDER_URL`, `EPH_MODEL` and the broker-released provider key if the hire
  declares one, and whose `settings` is empty — the program reads nothing from any
  cwd, so settings hygiene is trivially satisfied and the conformance case asserts
  it. `injectIdentity` writes the composed identity + protocol + memory text to a
  file in `engineConfigDir` the program loads as its system prompt's stable tier.
  `interrupt()` is `Ctrl-C` with a label. `resume` replays the JSONL transcript by
  session id. `transcripts` reads `<engineConfigDir>/sessions/<id>.jsonl`. Hook
  grade `native` is backed by the program emitting every §13.3 envelope itself.

## 4. Data models

### 4.1 Registry (`registry.json`)
```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "orchestratorId": "agent.artemis",
  "agents": {
    "agent.artemis": {
      "name": "Artemis", "role": "orchestrator", "engine": "claude",
      "isOrchestrator": true, "seat": "temple",
      "capabilities": ["routing","adjudication","scribe","briefing","chair"],
      "profile": null, "target": null,
      "status": "idle",             // mirror of avatar state, coarse
      "hookFidelity": "native",
      "envGrants": [], "budget": { "dailyTokens": 2000000 },
      "spawnedAt": "ISO-8601", "lastSeen": "ISO-8601"
    },
    "agent.mason": {
      "name": "Mason", "role": "ci-babysitter", "engine": "claude",
      "profile": "skeleton-crew", "target": "repo:myapp",
      "capabilities": ["ci","test-triage","git"], "seat": "terrace-3",
      "envGrants": ["GH_TOKEN"], "budget": { "dailyTokens": 500000 },
      "hire": { "template": "ci-babysitter", "version": 3 }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Task ledger (`tasks.json`)
```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "tasks": [{
    "id": "t-2026-08-26-041",
    "title": "Fix flaky checkout test",
    "spec": "…self-contained; written by Artemis…",
    "assignee": "agent.mason",
    "status": "in_progress",       // todo|in_progress|blocked|review|done|stalled
    "priority": 2,
    "deps": ["t-…-040"],
    "review": ["deck"],            // Odeon gates: deck and/or memo refs required
    "gates": [],                   // open Watch gate ids blocking this task
    "artifacts": { "deck": null, "memos": ["m-102"], "resultRef": null },
    "source": { "kind": "directive", "via": "voice", "log": "log#8842" },
    "createdAt": "…", "updatedAt": "…"
  }]
}
```
The harness rejects `status→done` while `review` obligations lack artifacts (ADR-0008)
or `gates` is non-empty.

### 4.3 Event log (`log.jsonl`) — one JSON object per line
```jsonc
{ "ts": 1724668800123, "seq": 8843, "kind": "message",
  "from": "agent.mason", "to": "agent.artemis", "act": "inform",
  "subject": "checkout test green", "msgId": "…", "conversation": "conv-7f3" }
```
`kind ∈ { message, delivery, bounce, spawn, exit, ghost, hook, task, gate, memo,
brief, deck, meeting, breaker, budget, memory, orchestrator, remote, secret-rotated, profile,
gym, stoa, shutdown, capacity, respawn, error, degradation }`. `capacity` carries the provider's usage
limit (`src/shared/capacity.ts`): parked (with the engine's own refusal text and
the retry it is waiting for), resuming (and by which of the two continuations),
cleared. It is distinct from `breaker` and from `exit` on purpose — one is our
ladder, one is a dead process, and this is a healthy agent the provider declined
to serve. `degradation` carries a CONDITION the company is running under rather than an
event that happened (M8.2): `source`, a stable `cause` (`<source>/<slug>`), the
latest `detail`, the `count` the row accounts for and `since`; the row with
`event: 'cleared'` says it ended and `forMs` how long it lasted. It is distinct
from `error` on purpose — "delivery threw" happened once, "recall is on the grep
rung" is still true, and only the second can be cleared or replayed. A repeating
cause reaches the file on a bounded ladder (the first occurrence, then each power
of ten, then the clear), so a check that reports every second costs five lines
rather than thousands; the exact count stays live in the UI, which reads the ring
rather than the file. At boot the log tail is replayed, so a condition that
outlived the last quit is shown as carried over rather than as a clean slate
(invariant §7; the model is `src/shared/degradation.ts`).
`respawn` carries the harness bringing an agent back (M8.6, `src/main/respawn.ts`):
`scheduled` with its `attempt` and `waitMs`, `respawned`, `deferred`/`released`
around a capacity hold, and `blocked` when a standing rung-3 stop refuses the
return. Its own kind rather than another `spawn`, because the question actually
asked of it — *did the company survive the night* — has to be answerable from
the log alone; it was answerable before only for the orchestrator, under
`orchestrator`, which is how "46 respawn-scheduled rows, all Artemis, zero crew"
could be established at all. The orchestrator's rows keep their historic
`orchestrator` names, so a year of log files stays readable.


`shutdown` carries closing time (GYM-003):
begin / ack / complete, with the shortfall named. `stoa` carries the research
cycle (§7.7): study started, brief accepted/rejected, watchlist changes. `orchestrator` carries Artemis's lifecycle (respawn ladder, down) and
FR-5.5's countersignatures and escalations.
Every kind carries enough refs to reconstruct the action (NFR-13). The activity UI,
briefing compiler, metrics, and forensics consume only this file + git history.

### 4.4 Hermes message (normative schema — ADR-0003)
```jsonc
{
  "id": "2026-08-26T14-03-11-123Z-a1b2",   // time-sortable unique
  "conversation": "conv-7f3",
  "in_reply_to": null,
  "from": "agent.mason",
  "to": "agent.artemis",                    // agentId | "broadcast" | "human"
  "act": "request",                         // request|inform|propose|query|agree|refuse|done
  "subject": "need staging DB creds decision",
  "body": "…markdown or structured payload…",
  "hops": 1,
  "requires_reply": true,                   // derived: act ∈ request|query|propose
  "needs_human": false,                     // router/Artemis may flip
  "created_at": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### 4.5 Decision memo (`odeon/memos/<id>/memo.md` + `verdict.json`)
Memo body is templated markdown: **Context / Options (≥2) / Recommendation / Blast
radius / Rollback**. Verdict:
```jsonc
{ "memoId": "m-102", "trigger": "new-dependency",
  "verdict": "approved",                    // approved|rejected|amended
  "decidedBy": "agent.artemis",             // or "architect"
  "countersigned": true, "authority": "delegated:test-code",
  "notes": "pin the version", "decidedAt": "ISO-8601", "taskId": "t-…-041" }
```

### 4.6 SQLite (app-local, never agent-visible)
`window_state`, `command_history`, `cost_ledger(agent, session, model, day, in_tokens,
out_tokens, cost_usd, source)` (append-only; ADR-0011). The org layer keeps no
`metrics_rollup` table after all: M5.6 chose recompute-on-read from `log.jsonl` +
the cost fold (DECISIONS-LOG 2026-08-28), so metrics can never disagree with the
book of record.
The recall keyword index is deliberately *not* here — it lives in `index/fts.sqlite`
(§2), because it is derived state a repair may delete and this file is not.

### 4.7 Stoa watchlist (`stoa/watchlist.json`) and research briefs (ADR-0017)
```jsonc
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "sources": [{
    "id": "src-hermes-agent",              // stable, slug-derived
    "url": "https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent",

                                            //  sibling of `sources`, not a flag on an
                                            //  entry, so `sources` holds only studiable
                                            //  sources by construction and a consumer
                                            //  that forgets to filter cannot study a

}
```
A **research brief** (`stoa/briefs/RB-<NNN>-<slug>.md`) is templated markdown with
required sections, validated by `stoa.ts` before archiving (an uncited finding
rejects the brief pre-human — FR-13.3): **Source** (watchlist id + `repo@commit`) /
**Question** (which tags this study served) / **Findings** (each with file-path
citations into the pinned commit) / **Applicability** (mapped to Ephesus subsystems,
cross-referenced to internal records where they exist) / **Candidate improvements**
(seeds for GYM proposals — candidates, not proposals) / **License note**. Briefs are
immutable once archived; proposals cite them by id in their evidence refs.

### 4.8 Restart records (app-local, ADR-0027)

Three files under the harness home, each `JsonStateStore`-managed: a
`schemaVersion`, an atomic temp+rename write, validation **before** writing as
well as on reading, and three distinguishable load outcomes — absent (an
ordinary first run), parsed, and damaged. Absent and damaged must never
collapse into one another: absent says nothing, damaged means state exists that
can no longer be read, and each has a different disclosed consequence.

```jsonc
// activations.json
{ "schemaVersion": 1,
  "instances": [{
    "instanceId": "skeleton-crew@repo:myapp",
    "plan": { /* the ActivationPlan verbatim — never re-derived (ADR-0027 §3) */ },
    "agentIds": ["agent.skeleton-crew-myapp-oncall"],
    "crew": "live" | "down",   // a RESTORED instance is always "down"
    "armed": ["skeleton-crew@repo:myapp/sweep"],  // emptied while the crew is down
    "pendingEvents": [{ "id": "…", "event": "ci" }],
    "activatedAt": "2026-09-05T03:00:00.000Z" }] }

// gates.json
{ "schemaVersion": 1,
  "open":    [ /* OpenGate, §9 */ ],
  "settled": [{ "id": "g-…", "verdict": "approved" }] }   // bounded at 1000, newest kept

// triggers.json
{ "schemaVersion": 1, "lastFired": { "standup": 1788631795998 } }
```

**Why `settled` is kept and not just `open`:** `decide` answers "was already
approved" out of it, which is what stops a repeated verdict being processed
twice (§6 criterion 6). A restart that dropped it turned every answered gate
back into "no open gate" — a different answer to the same question. Gate ids are
time-prefixed, so the bound keeps the newest by a lexicographic sort.

**What `crew` obliges the design to do** (the reasoning is ADR-0027 §2's; these
are the two behaviours it binds): a restored instance arms no triggers, and
`activate` takes over a `down` instance rather than refusing it as a duplicate
(FR-9.4).

**What is NOT here** is as load-bearing as what is: incident correlation,
capacity parks and breaker rungs 1–2 are deliberately not persisted. See
ADR-0027 §5 for the reasoning — the short form is *persist a decision about an
identity; do not persist an observation about a process, nor state a live
subsystem re-derives from a durable source.*

## 5. IPC contract (`window.eph`)

Typed, promise-based, all validated in main. Grouped surface (abridged — the `.d.ts`
generated from `ipc.ts` is normative once code exists):

```
agents:   list() spawn(cfg) kill(id) interrupt(id) resume(id) card(id) send(id, text)
          respawn(id)                               // M8.6: accepts the card's
          // RespawnOffer (§10). Rejects with the reason when a standing rung-3
          // stop refuses it — the same guard both ladders ask, so the human
          // path and the automatic ones cannot disagree
pty:      write(id, data) resize(id, cols, rows) onData(id, cb) onExit(id, cb)
avatars:  list()                                     // §6 snapshots; push on state:avatars
commands: list() submit(id, text)                    // FR-1.3 queue-until-idle

compacting · looping`. Transitions (event-plane driven; ADR-0002):

```
idle ──prompt-submitted──► alert ──pre-tool──► thinking(→station) ──arrive──► working
working ──post-tool──► thinking(→desk|→next station)
working|thinking ──stop(no pending)──► success ──250ms──► idle
stop(pending mail/task) ──block──► alert            (autonomy loop, ADR-0013)
any ──gate-opened──► blocked (wave at Watch post) ──verdict──► prior state
any ──waiting-on(agent|artemis)──► waiting
any ──breaker rung 1──► looping (tint) ──recover──► prior ──rung 3──► stopped

## 7. Key sequences

### 7.1 Directive → delegated work (UC-02)
```
Architect ─voice/text─► Herald policy ─► Artemis session (prompt)
Artemis: reads roster + board ─► writes tasks.json entries (via its ledger tool = files
  in its own outbox as `propose` to harness ledger endpoint) ─► Hermes `request` to each
  assignee with self-contained spec
Router: delivers ─► log.jsonl ─► committer batch ─► inbox wake if assignee idle
Worker: Stop-hook drains inbox ─► works ─► `done` + resultRef ─► Artemis verifies ─►
  board update ─► (review flags? → Odeon gates) ─► debrief queued
```

### 7.2 Standup briefing (UC-04)
```
scheduler ─trigger─► odeon.briefingCompiler:
  window = since last brief
  facts = ledger deltas + log events + budget deltas + harbor queue + open gates/memos
  each fact carries source refs (log seq / task id / memo id)
─► Artemis renders facts → narrative (template forbids unref'd claims)
─► artifact odeon/briefs/<ts>.md (+refs) ─► Herald speaks (barge-in live)
─► remote: bridge push with summary + link
```

### 7.3 Memo-gated action (UC-06)
```
Worker action ─► Watch gate policy match (e.g. package.json dependency add)
  ─► action held; worker notified with memo template ref
Worker files memo ─► odeon.memoQueue ─► Artemis triage:
  in delegated authority? ─ yes ─► verdict + countersign ─► gate release/refuse
                          ─ no ──► Architect queue (badge, optional Herald note,
                                    remote push) ─► verdict ─► same path
verdict ─► Hermes message to worker ─► memo archived immutable ─► log event
```

### 7.4 Voice failover (FR-8.2)
```
herald.policy streams TTS via ElevenLabs adapter
  ├─ adapter error / 401 / p95 latency breach detected
  ├─ policy: cancel stream, mark provider degraded (cooldown),
  │          re-issue utterance tail on OpenAI Realtime adapter
  └─ one-line notice (spoken + UI chip). Failback: manual from Settings.
```

### 7.5 Incident (UC-09, Skeleton Crew)
```
webhook/health trigger ─► profile trigger binding ─► on-call agent task (auto)
agent follows playbooks/incident.md: triage → reproduce → playbook fix
  fix ok ─► inform Artemis ─► log ─► next brief
  needs gated action ─► §7.3 path with incident context; severity-1 → Herald announces now
```

### 7.6 Gymnasium improvement cycle (UC-13, ADR-0015)
```
scheduler (gym cadence) ─or─ retro/breaker/memo-pattern signal
  ─► Artemis mines records (org metrics, log.jsonl, breaker/budget, drift audits)
  ─► ONE proposal drafted (evidence refs · change · cost/risk · metric+window · rollback)
  ─► gymnasium.ts validates shape — missing metric or rollback ⇒ rejected pre-human (FR-12.2)
  ─► gate classification (ADR-0015 authority table) ─► Architect queue
       (Artemis may rank/pre-screen; may NOT verdict — enforced in gym.verdict handler)
verdict approve ─► ledger row `approved` ─► lands via normal task/memo machinery (§7.1/§7.3,
  inside the gym budget slice, FR-12.5) ─► row `landed` ─► scheduler books metric check
metric check ─► measured vs declared target
  ─ met ──► row `validated`
  ─ missed/unmeasurable ──► row `regressed` ─► rollback per proposal ─► log kind:gym
every transition ─► log.jsonl kind:gym ─► next standup brief (§7.2) reports gym slice + outcomes
Mechanically refused regardless of verdict: proposals altering gym gating, accepted ADRs,
or the Watch's global maxima (FR-12.3 — the Gymnasium cannot widen its own authority).
```

### 7.7 Stoa research cycle (UC-14, ADR-0017) and the mode gate (UC-15, ADR-0018)
```
scheduler (stoa cadence — fires autonomously only in mode `improving`) ─or─ on-demand
  ─► stoa.ts picks ONE watchlist source (architect-registered; license recorded; pin set)
  ─► researcher spawn: read-only checkout at the pin · no secret grants · tags injected
       as the study question · source content is DATA (NFR-17 — embedded instructions
       become findings, never actions)
  ─► ONE brief drafted (source@commit · cited findings · applicability · candidates
       · license note)
  ─► stoa.ts validates shape — uncited finding ⇒ rejected pre-human (FR-13.3)
  ─► brief archived immutably (stoa/briefs/) ─► log.jsonl kind:stoa
  ─► Artemis reviews + ranks candidates ─► GYM proposal(s) filed citing the brief
  ─► from here §7.6 unchanged: Artemis pre-screens, the Architect verdicts

Build state (M5b, recorded at the close-out audit): the cadence half above is a
HEARTBEAT — `stoa-cadence.ts` picks a source, builds the plan, and logs
(`cadence-fired`, mode-tagged); the researcher-SPAWN leg that turns the plan
into a running study is M7's, with the Recursive Improvement profile (§7.8).
Until then, autonomous cycles produce visible records, not briefs.

mode change (UC-15): architect requests `improving`
  ─► modes.ts (`CompanyModes`) checks the proof gate (SRS §6.9, constants in
     shared/mode.ts) against gym ledger + log ONLY
       ─ evidence missing ──► refusal listing exactly what is missing
       ─ met ──► mode flips · status strip + next brief state it · autonomous records
                 tagged with the mode from here on (FR-14.1)
revert to `directed`: always one ungated architect action; breaker rung 3 on gym/stoa
work reverts automatically and lands on the ledger (FR-14.5)
```

### 7.8 Recursive Improvement delivery (UC-16, ADR-0019/0020)
```
architect activates the Recursive Improvement profile
  ─► profiles.ts checks company mode — `directed` ⇒ refusal naming §6.9's missing
       evidence; `improving` ⇒ triggers armed (deactivation / mode revert disarms)
architect presents a repo URL on the Stoa panel ─► watchlist entry (FR-13.1 unchanged)
stoa cadence ─► brief (§7.7) ─► Artemis ranks ─► proposal filed ─► architect verdict (§7.6)
verdict approve
  ─► improver takes the task in its own worktree, branch agent/<name>/<topic> (git.ts)
  ─► commits authored as the COMPANY identity + per-agent co-author trailer
       (token: broker env-grant to the improver role only — ADR-0010, NFR-17)
  ─► PR opened via harbor/github.ts under the company account, body citing
       GYM-<NNN> + RB-<NNN> ─► log.jsonl (remote-tagged) ─► architect's queue
architect merges ─► ledger row `landed` ─► metric check booked (§7.6 unchanged)
architect rejects ─► revision on the SAME branch (ENGINEERING-STANDARDS §7)
Mechanically absent: any agent merge path — the account holds write, main is
PR-and-review protected, so the host enforces what the harness promises.
```

---

### 7.9 Boot replay (NFR-5, ADR-0027)

What the company gets back when the process it was running in went away. The
ORDER is the design; `restore.ts` owns it because no individual store can.

```
boot()
  │  home, then the three JsonStateStores — BEFORE any subsystem that writes to
  │  them, so no change happens in a window where the store is still null
  ├─ agora.ensureRepo() → reconcile() → degradations.replay()        [M8.2]
  ├─ construct gates, …, activations
  │
  └─ restoreCompany(stores, targets)
       ① triggers   seed the last-fired clock. FIRST, so a restored trigger is
       │            not due the instant something arms it. (The scheduler keys
       │            the clock by id independently of registration, so this is a
       │            preference and not a hard ordering rule — an ordering
       │            requirement between two boot steps holds until someone
       │            moves a line, and nothing reports the day it stops holding.)
       ② activations put each instance back with crew = down. This is what makes
       │            planFor answer again, so tool grants (ADR-0026) and composed
       │            autonomy (FR-11.1) work for a rehired agent, and what puts
       │            the instance back in watchedRepos for the Harbor.
       ③ gates      open set + settled verdicts, WITHOUT re-firing onOpen — a
       │            restored gate is already in the queue the renderer reads on
       │            connect, and replaying the notification would announce a
       │            three-hour-old hold as if it had just happened, out loud on
       │            the voice surface.
       ④ reconcile  restored gates vs. task.gates in tasks.json:
       │              orphan → a task held by a gate in NO record. REPORTED by
       │                       task id, never released (NFR-9 deny-by-default).
       │              stale  → a restored gate no task holds any more. Dropped.
       │
       └─ RestoreReport { notes, problems, counts }
            notes    → console + log.jsonl  {kind: profile, event: restored}
            problems → reportDegradation('restart/…')                [M8.2]
  │
  └─ harbor = new GitHubHarbor(…); harbor.probe().then(ingest)
       ↑ the replay runs BEFORE this: ingest reads watchedRepos off the live
         set, so restoring later would leave the first ingest of every restart
         watching nothing.
```

It never throws — boot runs before the window exists, and a throw here is a dead
app rather than a degraded one (FR-5.4). Every store loads independently, so one
damaged record costs its own subsystem and nothing else.

**The crew is not respawned.** Without engine session recovery a respawned agent
re-reads its mailbox and redoes in-flight work, which is the double-processing
§6 criterion 6 forbids (ADR-0027 §2). `--resume` is owed; when it lands this
becomes auto-respawn without changing the restore.

## 8. The Herald — component design (ADR-0007)

```
┌ policy.ts ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ modes: PTT (always) · wake word (optional, local) ·      │
│ conversation policy: barge-in (≤250ms stop), repeat-back │
│ for destructive/spend approvals, provider selection +    │
│ failover state machine (healthy→degraded→cooldown)       │
└───┬───────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
    │ SpeechToText  │ TextToSpeech  │ DuplexVoice
    ▼               ▼               ▼
 elevenlabs.ts   elevenlabs.ts   openai-realtime.ts
 (streaming STT) (streamed TTS,  (speech↔speech session;
                  cancelable)     used as full fallback)
```

Audio I/O lives in main (device policy) with a thin renderer visualizer. The Herald
never mutates state directly: recognized intents become ordinary Artemis prompts /
gate verdicts through the same IPC-validated paths as clicks (ADR-0007 consequence).
Persona (voice id, style prompt, phrase book) loads from `prompts/herald/*`.

---

## 9. The Watch — enforcement points

- **Gate policy** evaluates at three choke points: engine tool-permission prompts
  (native), Hermes `needs_human`, and harness-mediated actions (Harbor posts, spend).
  Deny-by-default; profile autonomy levels can only *loosen* up to global maxima —
  stricter wins (ADR-0012).
- **Budgets**: pre-flight burn-rate projection per task + post-hoc ledger folding
  (§4.6). Breaker signal wiring per ADR-0011. Rung 1's corrective sentence rides
  the hook boundary on `native`-grade engines — the next `post-tool` reply
  carries it as a decision the shim already relays, so it lands mid-turn — and
  falls back to the FR-1.3 command queue below that grade; the channel taken is
  a `breaker`/`steer-channel` log event (GYM-002, `watch/steer-notes.ts`).
- **A rung-3 stop is sticky** (M8.6, B11). `Breaker` keeps a `BreakerStop` per
  agent — the signals and the numbers that caused it — recorded *before* the
  stop is performed, since the process is about to exit and the exit forgets
  the session. `forgetSession` (what an exit calls) drops the spans and the
  rung; `forgetAgent` (decommissioning) drops the stop too; `clearStop` is the
  Architect's, and returns the agent to rung 0, releasing delivery and budget
  constraints. Stops now persist in app-local `breaker-stops.json` (schema 1)
  through atomic replacement before stopping. Both initial hires and respawns
  refuse a standing stop. Unreadable storage blocks starts and is surfaced.
  Watch lists stops even without live cards; `clearBreakerStop(agentId, expectedAt)`
  validates the reviewed decision, persists removal and refreshes the offer
  without emitting another lifecycle exit. Clearing never itself spawns an agent.
- **Telemetry**: every tool call becomes a span (agent, tool, duration, outcome) →
  waterfall UI; spans are local-only (NFR-10).
- **Company mode** (ADR-0018): `directed`/`improving` lives in `config.json`
  (with `everEnabledImproving`, since the proof gate is a FIRST-enable check —
  M5b.3); every change is written to a **`## Mode changes` section under the
  Gymnasium ledger's proposals table**, not as a row in it: a mode change is not
  a proposal and would corrupt the eight columns the parser reads. The scheduler
  consults the mode through a `Trigger.enabled()` predicate, so autonomy is
  switched off at the one place that STARTS autonomous work rather than inside
  each cadence.
  `gym.setMode` is architect-verified in the handler (the `gym.verdict` pattern);
  the first `improving` enable is checked against the proof gate (SRS §6.9) read
  from the gym ledger + log only; the scheduler consults the mode before firing
  the Stoa/Gymnasium cadences; a rung-3 breaker stop attributable to gym/stoa
  work reverts the mode (FR-14.5). Researcher spawns get read-only checkouts and
  no secret grants — enforced here, not by convention (NFR-17). The Recursive
  Improvement profile (FR-9.5) activates only in `improving`, and the company
  GitHub token (FR-10.5) is a broker grant declared only by improver roles.

---

## 10. Error handling & recovery invariants

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Agent process crash | ghost → archive; ledger tasks back to `todo` with note (the note is a `task`/`returned` entry in `log.jsonl` — `tasks.json` carries no notes field); respawn offer on the agent card (`resumable` only where the adapter has `resume` *and* the event plane saw a session; `memorySections` from ADR-0006 layer 1). **Amended M8.6:** the offer is now RENDERED — it had zero references outside main until then, so a dead crew agent had no way back — and it carries `blockedBecause`, so a card never shows a control for a respawn that would be refused. A hire whose bundle declares `onExit: "respawn"` additionally gets a backoff ladder (`respawn.ts`, three rungs, five-minute stability window); the default stays `offer` |
| Agent stopped by the breaker at rung 3 | The stop is a decision about the AGENT, not about the process: it is recorded before the stop is performed and outlives the exit it causes (M8.6, B11). It refuses every respawn path — the crew's ladder, the orchestrator's ladder, and the Architect accepting the offer — until a human clears it (`Breaker.clearStop`), which also returns the agent to rung 0. Before this, `forget` ran on every exit including the one rung 3 had just caused, so an exhausted budget cycled instead of stopping: 21 climbs to rung 1 against exactly one completed stop across a 24.9M-token day |
| Worktree isolation requested and unavailable | The spawn is REFUSED, naming git's own reason, and the agent id is released so the Architect can fix the repository and activate again (M8.6, Architect decision 2026-09-04). It used to log the failure and continue in the Architect's own checkout; that fallback was the harm isolation is requested to prevent. Profile activation is all-or-nothing, so one refused hire refuses the instance rather than leaving a partial crew |
| Harness crash | On start: committer reconciles uncommitted Agora files; cursors prevent re-processing; PTYs are gone — agents relisted as `ghost`, resumable ones offered. **Amended M8.8 (ADR-0027):** the boot replay (§7.9) additionally restores the live coordination state that has no committed file — active mission instances, open gates *and their settled verdicts*, and the trigger last-fired clock. A restored instance comes back with its crew **down** and arms no triggers; the Architect rehires by reactivating it. A durable block in `tasks.json` whose gate is in no record is an ORPHAN: reported by task id, never released, because auto-clearing it would approve an action no human ever saw. Anything that cannot be read is a `restart/*` degradation naming its consequence — a record that is ABSENT is an ordinary first run and says nothing, a record that is DAMAGED says so |
| Hook socket down | Engine shims fail-open (agent unaffected); floor freezes with a visible "events stale" banner, never invents motion |
| Message to dead agent | bounce `refuse` + log (FR-3.4) |
| Git lock contention | impossible by construction (single committer); stale locks from crashes cleaned at startup (ADR-0004). **Amended 2026-10-02:** "single" includes git's own housekeeping. The `git maintenance run --auto` every commit starts runs inside that commit, never detached (`maintenance.autoDetach=false`, `src/main/git.ts`), so once Hermes is stopped and settled, `drained()` resolving means no git process the committer started is still writing `.git` — short of a commit the runner's 20 s timeout kills, whose housekeeping finishes on its own. On POSIX it used to daemonize: git 2.55 repacked in the background, and a teardown that trusted `drained()` met `ENOTEMPTY` on `.git`. The price is an occasional slow commit, measured in `docs/implementations/2026-10-02-pacing-wakes-teardown.md` §6 |
| Voice provider down | failover §7.4; both down → text-only banner, zero feature loss outside audio (FR-8.6) |
| Recall index corrupt | delete + rebuild from markdown (derived state, §2) |
| Schema drift (hooks/profile) | validate, warn visibly, degrade per FR-2.3 / refuse activation with diff |
| Orderly quit with live agents (GYM-003, `closing.ts` + `shutdown.ts`) | **Every quit gesture runs one sequence, once** (amended M8.1): `before-quit` holds the exit, `shutdown.ts` runs closing time → agent unwind → the stops, and only then does the app go. Closing time is *offered*, never forced: on accept, every live agent gets a `request` from `agent.closing` (park WIP, append state to `memory.md`, acknowledge); acks route back as an endpoint hand-off; teardown proceeds when all ack or at the hard deadline, with every silent agent named in the report and `log.jsonl` (`kind: shutdown`). "Quit now" and an empty floor skip straight to teardown. Amended again M8.7: a DISARM phase runs between closing time and the unwind, because the respawn ladders must be down while the agents they watch are still alive — M8.6 registered `crew.stop()` among the stops, which run LAST, so every ladder was armed while the unwind killed the agents it was watching and read those kills as crashes. `disarm` carries the crew ladders and the orchestrator's (whose `stop()` had no production caller at all until then). Each phase is isolated: a closing that cannot start must not stop the unwind, an unwind that fails must not leave the PTYs running or the database open, and a ladder that will not disarm must not cost the unwind its settings restores. On macOS closing the last window leaves the company running and `activate` re-attaches the bridge to the new one; elsewhere it quits, through the same sequence |

## 11. Performance budget allocation (NFR-1…NFR-4)

- Floor: one Pixi ticker, sprite batching, animations pause when window hidden; log
  rendering virtualized + batched (30-agent degradation mode: 30 fps floor, coalesced
  log appends).
- PTY: direct binary IPC channel per agent, no JSON wrapping of byte streams.
- Hermes: fs-watch debounce 50 ms; delivery p95 budget 500 ms includes commit batching
  (commits happen *after* inbox visibility — delivery is rename, durability is commit).
- Herald: TTS streaming starts on first chunk; briefing compile is data-side (< 500 ms)
  before narration begins.

## 13. The native engine and the bench (ADR-0036 · planned for M9 — design, not yet built)

Written at plan time (2026-10-02) so M9's packages are built against a design
rather than discovering one. Where a package lands differently, this section is
amended in that package's PR and the difference is recorded; until then every
statement here is a *decision about shape*, not a description of code.

### 13.1 The loop (`src/engine/loop.ts`)

```
spawn → load stable tier (identity · PROTOCOL · memory, from the file §3 names)
      → emit session-start
      → loop:
          messages = stable tier + context tier + volatile tier (§13.2)
          response = provider.complete(messages, tools, { stream: true })
          for each tool call in response, in call order:
              emit pre-tool {tool, args}            ← the harness may answer HOLD (§13.4)
              result = registry.dispatch(call)      ← contained; may raise a gate
              emit post-tool {tool, ok, provenance}
              append result to transcript, tagged trusted:false
          if no tool calls and no text for N turns → emit notification{stall} → end turn
          at end of turn: emit stop → reply {decision:'block', reason} ⇒ continue with reason as input
                                      reply ∅ ⇒ idle; wait for PTY input or an inbox wake
```

The Stop reply contract, block cap and `stop_hook_active` are ADR-0013's and are
not re-implemented: the program sends the same envelope `eph-hook` would and obeys
the same answer. What is new is only that the program *is* the engine, so nothing
has to be installed into a settings file to make it ask.

### 13.2 Prompt tiers and compaction

Three tiers, in the order §3.2 of the Hermes Agent study observed and this design
adopts: **stable** (identity, protocol, memory — never changes within a session, so
a provider that caches prefixes can), **context** (granted runbooks, the task spec
and inbox mail delivered this session), **volatile** (the turn history). Compaction
(`prompts/engine/compact.md`) runs when the volatile tier crosses a declared share
of the model's context length: the model is asked to summarise the volatile tier
only, the summary replaces it, a `compacting` envelope is emitted, and a
`{"kind":"compaction"}` boundary row is written to the transcript so the ledger
folds usage once. The stable tier is compared byte for byte before and after, and
a mismatch is a refusal, not a warning — the ADR-0026 hook-author rule applied to
the agent's own instructions.

### 13.3 Hook emission

The program posts the existing `HookEnvelope` (`src/shared/hooks.ts`,
`schemaVersion` 1) for `session-start`, `pre-tool`, `post-tool`, `stop`,
`notification` and `compacting`, through `shims/hook-client.mjs`, authenticated by
the per-spawn token like any shim. No new envelope kinds: the avatar state machine,
the breaker, telemetry and Hermes consume what they consume today. `pre-tool` is the
one envelope whose *reply* carries meaning for a native agent (§13.4).

### 13.4 Tools and the gate (ADR-0039, planned)

The registry is closed: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `list`, `search`, `shell`,
`recall`, `mail`. Each is a zod schema in `src/shared/tools/` and a dispatcher in
`src/engine/tools/`. Containment is the `tool-grants.ts` rule at every path
argument — inside the worktree, a granted tool directory, the mailbox or the
runbooks, resolved through `realpath` and checked with `lstat` for junctions, or
refused with the root named. `shell` consults the hire's `unattended` grants
(ADR-0035) exactly as `claude.ts` renders them today: a match runs; a non-match
sends `pre-tool` with `wants: 'decision'`, and the harness opens a gate of a **new
kind** (`native-tool`) through `GateManager` — the `tool-permission` kind stays
refused for wrapped engines, so the two never share a path. The program blocks on
the gate's verdict; approval runs the command, rejection returns a refusal to the
model as a tool result, and both are rows. A script cannot settle it (ADR-0033).
`mail` writes the agent's own outbox atomically; the router is unchanged.

### 13.5 The bench (ADR-0037, planned)

```
bench/tasks/<id>.json      { schemaVersion, id, fixture, break, verifier, timeBoxMs, clauses[] }
scripts/bench.cjs          → EPH_HOME=<fresh> · harness boot (headless when M9.7 lands)
                           → ephctl consent:grant · budget:set · profile:activate --target <fixture>
                           → apply the break · wait for the time box or completion
                           → score: log.jsonl + cost ledger → row
docs/bench/LEDGER.md       append-only; one row per run; refused without a full condition
```

Switches (`switches: { identity, memory, playbooks, mail, gates, stopLoop }`) are
passed to the harness as a bench-only activation option that disables the named
contribution for that instance and records which were off on every row. The
scorer is pure over the two durable sources and has its own discrimination suite
(S-BENCH): a scripted good run passes, each named failure mode fails, and a row
with a missing condition is refused.
