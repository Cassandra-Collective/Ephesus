# Ephesus — Architecture Decision Records

One record per load-bearing decision. Format: Status / Context / Decision / Options
considered / Consequences / Prior art. Statuses: `accepted`, `proposed`, `superseded`.
New ADRs append; accepted ADRs are never edited, only superseded.

**Numbers 0037–0039 are reserved, not missing.** ADR-0037 (the bench), ADR-0038
(the provider seam) and ADR-0039 (the gate as a native agent's permission system)
are owed by M9.0 and M9.3 and named in [`../M9-PLAN.md`](../M9-PLAN.md) §5.
ADR-0040 was written first because its decision was taken first (2026-10-03).

**Clause notes** (an accepted ADR is never edited; a clause overtaken by a
recorded decision is listed here so its sentence is not read as current):

- ADR-0034 Consequences, "`DIAGNOSIS.md`'s *book of record* row reads
  `WAITING FOR YOU` on a busy home" — overtaken the next day (2026-09-09) by the
  Architect's decision that **a blocked instance writes nothing into a home it
  does not own**: not the report, and not the shared `log.jsonl` either. So
  `agora/home-occupied` can no longer reach a rendered row — the owner never has
  the condition, and the instance that has it never writes — and the
  `waitingWhen` predicate that clause described was deleted with its tests
  rather than kept as a check that cannot fire. The rest of ADR-0034 stands, and
  the condition is still shown in the blocked instance's own window (invariant
  §7 owes ITS user the truth).

- ADR-0026 Consequences, "That is owed, not built -- it is M8.7b, and until it
  lands a crew working on this repository cannot reach `doc-guardian`,
  `spec-verifier`, or the `/build-package` family" -- M8.7b LANDED the same day
  (2026-09-05, `docs/implementations/2026-09-05-granted-tools.md`). A hire
  template now declares `tools`, and the harness hands each granted directory
  over as `--plugin-dir`. The rest of ADR-0026 stands as written.

- ADR-0023 "writes each observation to `<home>/usage.json`" — as built, one
  report per agent at `<home>/usage/<agent>.json`. The account WINDOWS are
  account-wide and a single file served them, but the report also carries the
  live per-session cost, and one shared file is last-writer-wins: whichever
  agent rendered most recently would have every other agent's spend attributed
  to it. The decision is unchanged; only the file layout is.
- ADR-0011 "Budgets are enforced pre-flight where possible (burn-rate
  projection) … budget state feeds trip signal #4" — superseded by ADR-0023.
  The per-agent `dailyTokens` ceiling survives as a runaway backstop and
  `breached` still feeds signal #4, but `projected-breach` no longer trips the
  breaker, and normal operation is governed by the account's resetting usage
  window instead. The rest of ADR-0011 stands.
- ADR-0008 §4 "minutes + action items written to blackboard + ledger on close" —
  as built (M5.5, DECISIONS-LOG 2026-08-28), minutes archive in `odeon/minutes/`
  and action items go to the orchestrator as a `request`; nothing but the single
  scribe writes `board.md`/`tasks.json` (FR-4.2, ADR-0004). SDD, which takes
  precedence, states the built behavior.
