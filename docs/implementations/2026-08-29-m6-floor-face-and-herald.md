## M6.1 — Citizens v2 (UI-DESIGN §5.1) and status overlays (§5.2)

### Problem / motivation

The M1.5b citizens met the §7 bar as it was written then: eight directions, four
frames, ≤ 5 colours. UI-DESIGN v2 (landed at the M5b close-out) made §7 exact and
in doing so contradicted the implementation on one clause:

> **Directions:** 8, drawn — diagonals are frames, not runtime flips (a flip
> breaks asymmetric silhouettes: a satchel, a scroll case).

`citizen.ts` built its four westward directions by mirroring the eastward ones
about the cell's centre line. That is precisely the shortcut §5.1 names, and it
was already costing the thing §5.1 wants most — **identity by shape**: the
scribe's scroll case and the worker's hip satchel jumped from one side of the
body to the other whenever a citizen turned west.

Two further gaps: nothing reserved the head-room §5.2 needs (the M1 head was
drawn at row 2), and there were no status overlays at all — the floor said
"working" only through the badge glyph.

Separately, the M5b close-out recorded an owed item against this package: *"the
reading-desk pin fix carries no renderer regression until M6.1 establishes a DOM
harness."*

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/renderer/src/floor/citizen.ts` | Rewritten to §5.1. Mirror table deleted; eight authored `VIEWS`. New anatomy (hairline, neck, tunic hem, sleeve+hand arms), 1 px ink silhouette backing, `hairSide` directional cue, six role silhouettes at the table's pixel sizes, `frameAt()` as the single 125 ms clock. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/overlay.ts` | **New.** §5.2's table as data, total over every `AvatarPhase`; 8×8 pixel matrices; `overlayFrame(spec, elapsedMs)` pure in elapsed phase time. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/FloorCanvas.tsx` | Draws the overlay in the reserved head-room; passes `phaseElapsedMs = now − snapshot.sinceMs`; sprite alpha now read from the overlay table (`ghost` 0.5 per §5.2) instead of a literal `0.45`; new palette field names. |
| `src/renderer/src/StoaPanel.tsx` | `registerDraft()` extracted as an exported pure function; `SourceRow` / `BriefCard` extracted as exported presentational components. No behaviour change. |
| `vitest.config.mts` | `esbuild: { jsx: 'automatic' }`; `.test.tsx` added to `include`. |
| `tsconfig.web-test.json` | **New** fourth project for renderer render-tests (JSX + DOM lib). |
| `tsconfig.node.json` | Excludes `test/renderer/**/*.tsx`. |
| `package.json` | `typecheck` runs the fourth project. |
| `test/renderer/citizen.test.ts` | Rewritten for §5.1 — 20 cases. |
| `test/renderer/overlay.test.ts` | **New** — 14 cases. |
| `test/renderer/stoa-panel.test.tsx` | **New** — 11 cases; the owed reading-desk regression. |
| `docs/demo/m6-1-citizens-v2.svg` | **New** — contact sheet rendered from the shipped modules. |

### Implementation approach

**Eight drawn directions.** Each direction owns a row in `VIEWS` giving its own
head/torso/arm/leg geometry plus two orientation facts that a mirror cannot
express:

- `propSide` (−1 / 0 / +1) — which side of the body faces the viewer, so a
  shoulder-worn satchel lands where it is actually worn;
- `hairSide` — which side carries the skull's hair mass, i.e. the side turned
  *away*. This is the strongest directional cue available at 32 px, and it is
  the second reason a flip is wrong: flipping would carry the back of the head
  round to the front.

Plus `backProps` / `frontProps` gates, so a back-slung scroll case is simply
absent from the front views rather than teleported.

**The anatomy is banded once** (`HEAD_Y … FOOT_TOP`) so nothing drifts:

```
rows 0–7    overlay head-room — no body pixel, at any bob phase
rows 10–20  head (hair cap rows 10–13, eyes row 16)
rows 21–22  neck
rows 23–35  torso (hem rows 34–35)
rows 36–43  legs — these absorb the bob by changing height
rows 44–47  feet — planted, never move
```

**The bob is ±1 px indexed by frame**, `[0, −1, 0, +1]`: level on the two idle
frames, up on step-A, down on step-B. Because it is indexed by the *frame* and
the frame comes from `frameAt(elapsedMs)` at 125 ms boundaries, §5.1's "sampled
at frame boundaries only (never render-time sine)" is structural rather than a
convention. The feet do not bob, which is both what a walk looks like and what
keeps a +1 px body inside the 48 px cell.

**The silhouette backing.** Each body part emits an ink rectangle one pixel
larger on every side; all backings are drawn before all fills, so the outline
comes out continuous around the figure rather than as seams between parts. This
is why the head starts at row 10: `10 − 1 (bob) − 1 (backing) = 8`, exactly the
first row §5.1 permits a body pixel.

**Overlays as projections.** `overlayFor(phase)` gives the mark; the frame comes
from `overlayFrame(spec, nowMs − snapshot.sinceMs)`. `sinceMs` is stamped by main
when the phase began, so *what is on screen is a function of event-plane facts
only*. The module holds no timer, no counter, no previous frame — replay
`log.jsonl`, get the same avatar snapshots, and the same overlay appears at the
same moment (NFR-13's spirit in the vfx layer). A renderer-owned `setInterval`
would keep animating after the events stopped: motion projecting no fact, which
§1.2 cuts.

`working` is declared as kind `token` with **no pixels**, because §5.2's working
row *is* §5.3's carrying token and §5.3 is M6.3. A placeholder mark would be a
shape projecting no fact. The phase still reads through the badge glyph and the
floor census, so nothing is lost; `overlay.test.ts` asserts the empty-until-§5.3
seam explicitly.

### Design decisions

- **Exact role vocabulary, not substring matching.** §5.1 names roles by
  category ("Scribe / docs"), so `ROLE_SILHOUETTES` keys on those words plus the
  role strings the company already uses. A substring test would let a hire named
  `process-improver-docs` match `docs` — the M5b audit's `includes('improv')`
  defect one domain over. Unknown roles hash deterministically over the five
  assignable silhouettes; `orchestrator` is unreachable by hash, being Artemis's
  alone.
- **`react-dom/server` over jsdom for the harness.** A DOM library is a new
  dependency and therefore a BUILD-PROMPT §8 must-ask, and the owed coverage did
  not require one. Static markup renders the *shipped* component bodies — never
  a copy, the M5b rig lesson — and what it cannot reach (effects, clicks) is
  tested at the module boundary instead, per BUILD-PROMPT §6. That is why
  `registerDraft` was extracted: the pin mapping is exactly the kind of
  one-expression logic that regresses silently inside a component. The jsdom
  upgrade is carried as a must-ask, not decided unilaterally.
- **A fourth tsconfig project** rather than adding `jsx` + DOM lib to
  `tsconfig.node.json`, which would loosen the whole main/shims/test surface to
  satisfy three files.

### Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && node scripts/check-invariants.cjs
npx vitest run test/renderer/
```

91 cases green across `test/renderer/` (citizen 20 · overlay 14 · stoa-panel 11 ·
tileset · walk). Full suite: 2164 passed; 12 failures, all in the recorded
Windows-local set — 9 deterministic (agent-worktree 4, s-crash 3,
claude-transcripts 1, cost 1) and 3 parallel-load flakes (library, s-livelock,
s-stoploop) each verified green in isolation. Ubuntu CI is the gate.

**Both new regressions were mutation-checked** — a regression that does not fail
on its own defect is worthless:

| Mutant | Result |
|---|---|
| Westward directions rebuilt by runtime flip | `does not build a westward direction by flipping its eastward twin` FAILS |
| `registerDraft` pin re-hard-coded to `null` | `carries a typed pin through, trimmed` FAILS |

**Live run.** `npm run dev` booted the real app: hook endpoint on the named
pipe, Agora reconciled, floor rendering with the LimeZu pack. The art itself is
in [`docs/demo/m6-1-citizens-v2.svg`](../demo/m6-1-citizens-v2.svg), rendered by
importing `citizenSprite` and `overlayPixels` so the evidence cannot drift from
the code. **The live render is what caught the real defect:** the first §5.1
sprite passed all twenty unit tests and looked like a stack of boxes that
dissolved into the terrace, because `skin` is `sand` and that is exactly
`worldTerraceA`. Asserting a spec is not the same as meeting the quality bar it
serves — the fifth time this project has paid for "believe the demo over the
suite".

## M6.2 — Stations and furnishings v2 (UI-DESIGN §5.4, §5.7)

### Problem / motivation

§5.4 gives every station a **size** — the Odeon 96×64, the temple seat 64×64,
a desk 64×32 — and three **states** whose rule is stated at the end of the
section:

> Every state maps to an event-plane fact; no station animates on a timer alone.

Neither was true of the floor. Each station held exactly one 32×32 tile, so the
size column was decorative; and nothing on the floor moved for a station at all,
so the three facts §5.4 singles out — the desk's inbox tray, the Watch brazier,
the Odeon filling — were invisible. The tray one matters most: it is the
ADR-0013 wake watchdog made visible, and `pendingMailCount` did not reach the
renderer at all.

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/shared/stations.ts` | **New.** §5.4's state model: `stationView` / `stationViews`, `deskTray`, `stationCensus`. |
| `src/shared/floor.ts` | `STATION_SIZES` + `stationTiles` + `stationFootprint`; `floorPlan()` claims footprints; `PlanCell` gains `part`; the Odeon anchor moves to col 16. |
| `src/shared/tileset.ts` | Optional `compositions` (§5.4) and `furnishings` (§5.7); `validateCompositions`, `compositionFor`, `furnishingsOf`. |
| `src/shared/ipc.ts` | `AvatarUpdate.pendingMail`. |
| `src/main/index.ts`, `src/main/ipc.ts` | One `pendingMailFor` source feeding the autonomy loop, the push and the list handler. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/station-art.ts` | **New.** The marks: highlight outline, brazier flame, Odeon fill, working accent, desk tray. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/atlas.ts` | `compositionFrameFor` (row-major from the top-left), `furnishingFrame`. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/painter.ts` | `paintFurnishings`; per-cell painting now respects `part` so a structure paints as one structure. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/FloorCanvas.tsx` | Station layer, desk trays, gate/meeting facts, station census in the label. |
| 3 test files | 24 + 17 cases, plus the `avatars:list` seam case. |

### Implementation approach

**The state model cannot invent a state.** `stationView(station, facts, nowMs)`
returns `{ activity, frame, because }`, and `because` is the event-plane fact in
words. Anything but `idle` requires one, so the §5.4 rule is a property of the
return type rather than of the author's memory — a station somebody wants to
animate decoratively has nothing to put in the field. `stationCensus()` renders
the same values as text, which is how §8's information parity is satisfied
without a second model to drift.

Precedence is `in-use` > `highlighted` > `idle`. The two room-level facts are
checked first, because a gate is open whether or not anyone is standing at the
post — which is the entire point of showing it.

**Footprints.** A station anchors on its `STATION_TILES` tile and extends right
and **up**, exactly as the 32×48 citizen does, so the tile a walk targets is
still the ground the structure stands on. `stationFootprint()` drops tiles
outside the room, so a footprint can never claim a wall.

**The map grew, not the code.** §5.4 compositions and §5.7 furnishings are
optional fields on `*.tiles.json`. `validateCompositions` enforces two rules,
both because the failure is otherwise silent: `frames.length === cols × rows`,
and the footprint must equal `stationTiles(station)`. A broken entry degrades
that station to its single frame and then to the procedural painter; it never
throws. Both checks are map-only, so CI validates them with no sheets present —
the M5b drop-guard rule (guard sheet-dependent checks on the sheet, not the map).

### Design decisions

- **`pendingMail` on `AvatarUpdate`, not on `AvatarSnapshot`.** The snapshot is
  the SDD §6 machine and mail is not one of its states. It rides the addressed
  wrapper so the count and the snapshot describe the same agent at the same
  moment; a separate channel could disagree, and the floor would raise a flag on
  a citizen who had just consumed the mail. One source in main feeds all three
  consumers.
- **Geometry in `floor.ts`, behaviour in `stations.ts`.** The plan needs the
  sizes and the state model does not, so the dependency runs one way.
- **Polling the meeting.** SDD §5's event list has a `gate:open` push but none
  for a live meeting, so the Odeon fill polls `odeon.meeting()` at the cadence
  the panels already use. This is the gap the `odeon:queue` badge carried item
  names; it closes on M6.7's scheduler work rather than being papered over with
  a new channel here.

### Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && node scripts/check-invariants.cjs
npx vitest run test/shared/stations.test.ts test/renderer/ test/main/ipc-handlers.test.ts
```

188 green across the touched suites. Full suite: 2205 passed; 14 failures, all
recorded — 9 deterministic Windows-local (agent-worktree 4, s-crash 3,
claude-transcripts 1, cost 1) and 5 parallel-load flakes (s-closing, s-livelock
×2, s-stoploop, s-wake), each verified green in isolation.

| Mutant | Result |
|---|---|
| `avatars:list` drops `pendingMail` | the listing-path seam case FAILS |

**Live run.** `npm run dev`, floor inspected in the browser: structures render
as structures, no console errors. [`docs/demo/m6-2-stations.svg`](../demo/m6-2-stations.svg)
is painted by the shipped painter and station art with facts injected — one gate
open lights the brazier, desks 1–3 holding mail raise their flags.

**The live floor caught the defect again.** With footprints landed and every
test green, the painter still worked per tile: a 64×32 desk painted as two
32 px desks, so a row of them read as one long slab, and a 2×2 station showed
four gold markers instead of one. `PlanCell.part` fixed it. That is twice in
this milestone — M6.1's citizens dissolved into the terrace, M6.2's stations
were wallpaper — and both times every assertion passed.

## M6.3 — Messaging and motion vfx (UI-DESIGN §5.3, §5.5, §5.6, §8)

### Problem / motivation

Three of the floor's four moving parts did not exist. A citizen walked back from
a station empty-handed, so a finished tool left no trace; Hermes delivered mail
with nothing visible crossing the room, so the system's central mechanism — the
indirection that *is* the design (ADR-0003) — was invisible; and §8's
reduced-motion clause ("information parity is a test case, not a hope") had
neither a test nor an implementation.

The risk the package plan names is the interesting one: *no vfx state
`log.jsonl` cannot reconstruct.* A floor that invents its own effect ids or
reads its own clock is holding state the record cannot account for, which is the
second source of truth ADR-0014 forbids.

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/shared/vfx.ts` | **New.** §5.3 tokens, §5.5 envelopes, §5.6 particles, §8 reduction — all pure, all derived from log entries. |
| `src/shared/avatar.ts` | `TOOL_CLASS_FOR_STATION` / `toolClassForStation` — the inverse of the §6 station map. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/vfx-art.ts` | **New.** The shapes, and the only place a colour token becomes a number. |
| `src/renderer/src/floor/FloorCanvas.tsx` | Vfx layer; `log:append` subscription; `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| `test/shared/vfx.test.ts` | **New** — 24 cases. |
| `test/main/vfx-seam.test.ts` | **New** — 6 cases against the real router. |
| `docs/demo/m6-3-vfx.svg` | **New** — the whole vfx vocabulary, from the shipped modules. |

### Implementation approach

**An envelope exists because the log says a message moved.** `envelopeFor(entry)`
takes a `LogEntry` and returns a flight or null. Its identity is `msgId`, its
colour is `act`, its start is the entry's own `ts`. There is no other
constructor. Replay `log.jsonl` and the same envelopes fly at the same moments —
which is what makes the vfx layer reconstructible rather than merely plausible.

The floor follows the existing `log:append` push and re-reads the tail, seeding
its cursor from the newest entry so that opening a window mid-run does not
replay the day's mail as a storm of envelopes.

**Tokens are keyed by class, and the class is recovered, not carried.** §5.3
keys tokens by tool class; an avatar snapshot carries only a station.
`STATION_FOR_TOOL_CLASS` is injective, so `toolClassForStation` inverts it —
no new field on the SDD §6 snapshot, and no path by which a tool *name* could
reach the floor (NFR-12). A regression asserts that `Read`, `Bash`, `WebFetch`
and friends resolve to nothing.

**Parity is equality, not a label.** Every effect produces a `VfxInfo` — what it
means, in the §9 register — and the reduced form produces the *identical* value:

```ts
expect(reduceEnvelope(flight).info).toEqual(envelopeInfo(flight))
```

That is checkable in a way "there is a label" is not: a label can exist and say
nothing. Walks reduce to `progress: 1` plus the same `walkInfo`; particles are
suppressed entirely, on the stated ground that each one's fact is already
carried by a badge, a tray flag or a log line.

### Design decisions

- **§5.3's `search` row stays unreachable; §6's `meeting` class gets `null`.**
  SDD §6's station map is the normative list of tool classes and has no
  `search`. Inventing one to satisfy a design-doc row would be a schema change
  smuggled in as art. Conversely `meeting` has no token in §5.3, so a citizen
  returns from the Odeon carrying nothing — honest, where invented art would
  not be. The table is total over `ToolClass`, so the compiler holds the line.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` rather than a new setting.** It is the signal the
  platform already gives, it needs no IPC or config schema, and it is live.
- **Colour tokens as names in shared code.** `ENVELOPE_COLOR` maps an act to a
  §2 token *name*; `vfx-art.ts` resolves it. Invariant §12 stays true of shared
  logic, and a test asserts every act's colour is a real token, not a hex.

### Verification

```bash
npx vitest run test/shared/vfx.test.ts test/main/vfx-seam.test.ts
```

30 cases green. Full suite: 2237 passed; 12 failures, all recorded — 9
deterministic Windows-local and 3 parallel-load flakes (odeon, s-livelock,
s-stoploop), each verified green in isolation.

**The seam test earns its place by demonstration.** `test/shared/vfx.test.ts`
writes its own log entries, which is precisely the two-correct-halves blindness
every milestone audit in this repository has found. So `test/main/vfx-seam.test.ts`
delivers real mail through the real Hermes into a real `log.jsonl` and asks the
model what flies. Renaming Hermes's `msgId` field shows the difference:

| Suite | Under the mutation |
|---|---|
| `test/shared/vfx.test.ts` (writes its own entries) | 24 / 24 **green** |
| `test/main/vfx-seam.test.ts` (reads the real log) | **3 cases fail** |

**Live run.** `npm run dev`; canvas renders, zero console errors, and the
accessible label now carries both halves — "Terraces floor: nobody on the floor ·
stations: all quiet". [`docs/demo/m6-3-vfx.svg`](../demo/m6-3-vfx.svg) shows the
whole vocabulary rendered from the shipped modules, including the parity lines.

## M6.4 — The Herald seam and its policy layer (ADR-0007, SDD §8)

### Problem / motivation

Nothing of the Herald existed: no `src/main/herald/`, no `prompts/herald/`. The
milestone's second half needs a place for the two adapters to plug into, and —
more importantly — a place for the decisions that must not live in an adapter.
ADR-0007 states the division in one sentence:

> The policy layer is where all safety-relevant voice behavior lives
> (repeat-back for destructive approvals, FR-8.4) — provider adapters stay dumb
> pipes.

The risk the package plan names is the M1.1 lesson: *transcribe the ADR
interface, don't extend it.*

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/main/herald/seam.ts` | **New.** ADR-0007's three interfaces, the fault taxonomy, `VoiceAdapter`. |
| `src/main/herald/policy.ts` | **New.** Modes, barge-in, repeat-back, the failover reducer. |
| `prompts/herald/persona.md`, `phrasebook.md` | **New.** The Herald's words, as config. |
| `test/conformance/voice-conformance.ts` | **New.** The TEST-STRATEGY §5 suite. |
| `test/conformance/voice-adapters.test.ts` | **New.** Runs it over both providers. |
| `test/fakes/fake-voice.ts`, `test/fixtures/voice/*.json` | **New.** Recorded fixtures. |
| `test/main/herald-policy.test.ts` | **New** — 24 cases. |

### Implementation approach

**The seam is a transcription.** `SpeechToText` (streaming transcription +
endpointing), `TextToSpeech` (streamed audio with cancel), optional
`DuplexVoice` — the three ADR-0007 names, with the shapes those words imply and
nothing else. Endpointing stays inside the adapter because providers differ
wildly in how they decide an utterance is over, and re-implementing it above the
seam would make every adapter fight the policy layer.

**Adapters report; they never decide.** There is no `shouldFailover()`, no
retry, no provider preference anywhere on the seam. An adapter's whole
obligation on failure is to classify the fault as `auth`, `transient` or
`latency-breach`. The conformance suite asserts those methods are *absent* by
name, so the boundary is checked rather than merely intended.

**The failover machine is one-way.** A fault burns its provider for the session;
`healthy → degraded → cooldown`; failback is manual, because a provider that
failed auth will fail it again and one that breached latency will do it under
the same load — a timer-based recovery would flap the session. A stale fault
from a provider already left is ignored, or it would burn the provider just
switched *to*. `cooldown` is the honest end state: no provider, voice off, and
FR-8.6 says everything else carries on in text.

**Repeat-back splits the safety property from the sentence.**
`repeatBackToken()` derives `confirm <first three words of the action>` from the
gate — specific, because "confirm" alone would be a bare assent with extra
steps. `checkRepeatBack()` refuses a bare assent with `because: 'bare-assent'`
rather than a generic mismatch, so the Herald can explain itself. The *asking*
sentence lives in the phrase book; the policy emits a key, never prose, and a
test greps the policy source to keep it that way.

### Design decisions

- **Three fault classes, not more.** They are exactly the three the policy
  treats differently; anything finer would be a distinction the reducer cannot
  act on.
- **Fixtures ship before adapters.** Same reasoning as BUILD-PROMPT's M1.2 (fake
  engine before the real adapter's tests): a suite authored beside its first
  adapter agrees with it by construction. The fixtures record each provider's
  *own* error shape — ElevenLabs' HTTP envelopes and Realtime's session events —
  rather than a normalised one, because an adapter that classified only one
  shape would pass a suite written against the other.
- **A phrase-book key as the notice.** FR-8.2 wants a one-line notice; invariant
  §8 wants the line in `prompts/`. `notice: 'switching-provider'` satisfies
  both, and a test asserts the notice contains no space — i.e. is a key.

### Verification

```bash
npx vitest run test/main/herald-policy.test.ts test/conformance/
```

24 + 20 cases green. Full suite: 2281 passed; 12 failures, all recorded — 9
deterministic Windows-local and 3 parallel-load flakes (odeon, s-livelock,
s-stoploop), which passed 36/36 when re-run together.

| Mutant | Result |
|---|---|
| `checkRepeatBack` accepts a bare "yes" | the FR-8.4 case FAILS |
| the stale-fault guard removed | two failover cases FAIL |

**No live provider was called, and none should have been.** The conformance
suite runs on recordings by design (TEST-STRATEGY §5); ADR-0007 keeps live smoke
tests opt-in with keys. The live proofs SRS §6.5 owes are M6.8's business.

## M6.5 — The ElevenLabs adapter and the Herald's words (ADR-0007, VOICE-DESIGN)

### Problem / motivation

M6.4 built a seam with nothing plugged into it. The reference implementation
ADR-0007 names — ElevenLabs, "chosen for voice quality and latency" — had to
exist, and with it the persona and phrase book FR-8.5 and invariant §8 keep out
of code.

Building it required a decision the docs left open: **what transport?** This
environment has no `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and no `OPENAI_API_KEY`, so a hand-rolled
streaming client could be asserted only against fixtures written by the same
hand that wrote the client. That is a BUILD-PROMPT §8.3 must-ask — a new
dependency — and it was put to the Architect with three options and approved:
add the provider SDKs.

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `package.json` | `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js@^2.65`, `openai@^7.8` (approved). |
| `src/main/herald/elevenlabs.ts` | **New.** The adapter. |
| `src/main/herald/phrasebook.ts` | **New.** Keys → sentences; persona and id loading. |
| `src/main/herald/seam.ts` | `SpeakOptions.onAudio` — the sink the M6.4 transcription lacked. |
| `prompts/herald/voice-id.md`, `model-id.md`, `stt-model-id.md` | **New.** Voice config. |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | Voice/engine SDK patterns exclude relative specifiers. |
| `test/main/herald-elevenlabs.test.ts` | **New** — 23 cases. |
| `test/conformance/voice-adapters.test.ts` | The shipped adapter joins the suite. |

### Implementation approach

**The adapter decides nothing.** It streams audio out through `onAudio`, streams
transcripts in, and classifies its own failures into the seam's three faults.
Endpointing stays the provider's. There is no method on it through which it could
express an opinion about failover, and both the conformance suite and a unit case
assert those method names are absent.

**`spokenSoFar()` is a measurement.** `streamWithTimestamps` returns character
alignment, so the adapter accumulates the characters the provider actually
produced audio for. VOICE-DESIGN §2's "unspoken from here" mark is therefore a
fact rather than an estimate; and where alignment drifts from the text, the
policy's `bargeIn` treats a non-prefix as "nothing was heard" — the safe
direction, because claiming the Architect heard something they did not is the
worse error.

**The key is injected, never read.** `check-invariants.cjs` *permits*
`process.env` under `herald/`, so the permission needed its own check: a test
strips comments from the adapter and asserts the code does not use it.

### Design decisions

- **SDKs over a hand-rolled client.** Recorded in DECISIONS-LOG with the
  approval. The deciding argument was verifiability, not convenience.
- **Fix the lint pattern, don't rename the file.** SDD §8's diagram names
  `elevenlabs.ts`; exempting the test directories would let a test import the
  real SDK. Excluding relative specifiers is the narrow fix — a relative import
  can never be an SDK import.

### Verification

```bash
npx vitest run test/main/herald-elevenlabs.test.ts test/conformance/
```

23 + 28 cases green. Full suite: 2311 passed; 13 failures, all recorded — 9
deterministic Windows-local and 4 parallel-load flakes, 25/25 in isolation.

**Two findings, both from doing rather than reading.**

1. *My own M6.4 seam was incomplete.* ADR-0007 says "streamed audio with cancel";
   the transcription had the cancel and no way for audio to leave. Found by
   writing an adapter against the seam — which is the argument for writing one
   rather than admiring it.
2. *The voice-SDK tripwire was a false positive on our own file.* eslint's
   `no-restricted-imports` `group` uses gitignore semantics, so bare
   `elevenlabs` matched `../../src/main/herald/elevenlabs`. Verified in **both**
   directions after the fix: still errors on a real SDK import outside
   `herald/`, no longer fires on the shipped adapter. A tripwire that stops
   catching what it exists for is the defect this repo keeps finding.

**No live provider was called.** There is no key in this environment, so the
live proof is OWED to a local session and recorded as such — not simulated and
called live.

## M6.6 — The Realtime fallback and S-FAILOVER (ADR-0007, FR-8.2, FR-8.6)

### Problem / motivation

M6.5 gave the Herald a voice; it gave it no second one. ADR-0007's whole
argument for two providers is that "a single external dependency between the
Architect and their company's mouth" means an outage silences the product. The
fallback, and the machinery that reaches for it mid-sentence, are this package.

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/main/herald/openai-realtime.ts` | **New.** `DuplexVoice`, and only that. |
| `src/main/herald/session.ts` | **New.** Where policy and adapters meet. |
| `src/main/herald/seam.ts` | `DuplexSession.say(text)`. |
| `prompts/herald/realtime-model-id.md` | **New.** Realtime model, as config. |
| `test/scenarios/s-failover.test.ts` | **New** — the S-FAILOVER suite, 11 cases. |

### Implementation approach

**The adapter stays incomplete on purpose.** It offers `duplex` and nothing
else. ADR-0007 says "the policy layer maps the common conversation contract onto
it", so `HeraldSession.speakWith` does: a `tts` adapter is spoken through, a
duplex adapter is asked to `say`. An adapter that faked TTS to look complete
would make the policy prefer it for capabilities it does not have.

**`speak()` loops on the reducer, not on a counter.** It tries whatever provider
the policy currently names, and on a classified fault hands it to
`reduceFailover` and continues from what is left unspoken. It ends when the line
is said or the reducer reaches cooldown — never after N tries, because "how many
providers remain" is the reducer's knowledge.

### Design decisions

- **`DuplexSession.say()` is a completion, not an extension.** Second time this
  milestone. The pattern is worth stating: transcribing an ADR's interface
  *names* is not the same as transcribing its *contract*, and only writing an
  adapter against the seam finds the difference.
- **Transport injected everywhere.** `OpenAIRealtimeWebSocket` needs the
  runtime's native `WebSocket` — Electron's Node has it, vitest's Node 20.16
  does not. With no transport the adapter reports a fault and refuses, which is
  a visible degradation rather than a crash inside the SDK.

### Verification

```bash
npx vitest run test/scenarios/s-failover.test.ts
```

11 cases green, running the shipped adapters, reducer and session. Full suite:
2320 passed; 15 failures, all recorded — 9 deterministic Windows-local and 6
parallel-load flakes, 38/38 in isolation.

**A defect the first green suite hid.** On a mid-utterance failure the session
lost what ElevenLabs *had* said: `await handle.done()` rejects, so
`spokenSoFar()` was never read, and the fallback re-spoke the whole line. All
eleven cases passed anyway — because "the whole line reached the transcript" is
true either way. The suite was asserting the wrong half of *continuous*.
`speakWith` now credits the partial on the failure path, and the continuity case
asserts what the fallback was **asked to say**:

| Mutant | Result |
|---|---|
| partial credit dropped (fallback repeats the line) | the continuity case FAILS |

**No live provider was called.** No keys in this environment; the live SRS §6.5
proof is OWED to a local session.

## M6.7 — The spoken company and the three carried items

### Problem / motivation

The Herald could speak but had nothing to say, and three deferrals from earlier
milestones came due here — all recorded honestly at the time, which means
closing them requires proving the thing each deferral said was missing.

The sharpest risk is E-BRIEF-FAITH: *the Herald narrates records*. An invented
sentence in a spoken brief is a claim the company never checked, and the archive
is precisely the artifact that already passed `checkNarrative` (SDD §7.2).

### What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/main/herald/narration.ts` | **New.** Brief narration, voice approvals, meeting lines. |
| `src/main/gym-cadence.ts` | **New.** SDD §7.6's metric-check booking. |
| `src/shared/attribution.ts` | **New.** Spend by scope, with its source named. |
| `src/main/gymnasium.ts` | `slice()` returns a number and a `source`. |
| `src/shared/brief.ts` | The brief prints the spend source. **CORRECTED at the close-out audit: it did not** — `slice()` emitted `source`, this file read `spendSource`, and nothing set it. Fixed on `fix/m6-closeout-audit`. |
| `src/main/index.ts` | Wires the gym cadence trigger and the real spend source. |
| `src/renderer/src/StatusBadge.tsx` | **New.** `CountBadge`, shared by gates and memos. |
| `src/renderer/src/App.tsx` | The `odeon:queue` badge — push plus poll. |
| `src/shared/config.ts` | `wakeWordEnabled` (setting only — see below). |
| 3 test files | ~~33~~ **34** cases *(corrected at the close-out audit: M6.8 added the GYM-003 note case without updating this count)*. |

### Implementation approach

**The narration parses the archive.** `narrationOf(markdown)` reads sentences
back out of what `renderBriefMarkdown` wrote, and `speakBrief` hands the session
only those strings. Taking a `BriefFiling` would have been easier and would have
let the spoken brief drift from the written one — a drift nobody would notice
until an audit read both.

**The metric tick raises; it does not measure.** Booking a check and deciding
what the number was are different jobs, and only the first is scheduling. A
check stays due until somebody runs it, because the row stays `landed` — a
booking that fired once and forgot would let a missed check disappear, and R2
says the ledger is total.

**Attribution takes a lookup, not rows.** Production passes the `CostLedger`'s
own `spendFor(...).cumulativeTotals`; a test passes a table. One number, one
route. The figure is durable (invariant §11) and attributed by exact role, so
the M5b audit's substring trap cannot reopen here.

### Design decisions

- **Repeat-back for spend even when the gate did not ask.** FR-8.4 names
  destructive *and* spend; `gate.requiresRepeatBack` answers a different
  question. Requiring the token when either says so means a policy that had not
  marked a spend gate cannot let one through on a bare "yes".
- **`CountBadge` outside `App.tsx`.** Importing `App` pulls in xterm and Pixi,
  which need a browser. Chrome carrying a rule worth pinning should be reachable
  from the M6.1 harness without booting the shell.
- **The wake word is a setting, not a detector — owed, not faked.** No local
  wake-word engine is an approved dependency, and one that only pretended to
  listen would be worse than the gap. Push-to-talk is unaffected.

### Verification

```bash
npx vitest run test/main/herald-narration.test.ts test/main/carried-items.test.ts test/renderer/
```

~~33~~ **34** cases green *(and that command actually runs 142 across 9 files — it globs `test/renderer/`; corrected at the close-out audit)*. Full suite: 2357 passed; 11 failures, all recorded — 9
deterministic Windows-local and 2 s-stoploop flakes (8/8 in isolation).

**Live run.** `npm run dev`: the `memos:` badge is on the status strip beside
`gates:`, in the unread state with no bridge — the invariant §7 behaviour the
test pins, seen rather than assumed.
